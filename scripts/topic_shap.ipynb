      "0 Pizza by Napoli will always have a place in my heart. I have been frequenting this place for over 7 years now and NOT ONCE has it compromised in taste, style or service. I know when I go there years from now, I will get to enjoy every reason that makes this place special for me. Taste-wise, I can speak for the pizza, wings and beer as this is all I ever want when I go...BECAUSE THERE SO DAMN GOOD!!! The pizza has an amazing taste to the sauce that can only be experienced and that will hopefully one day be recognized as the sauce all pizza should use! The wings have a nice crunchiness but are still traditionally bathed in an awesome wing sauce and worth every bit of mess you make of yourself. The beer is served right and makes the food that much better. When I say served right; I'm speaking of the thick, LARGE, glass pitcher that you could use to battle any incoming zombies or just use it to fill up the ice dripping mugs! Keep in mind, this place has a huge menu so don't think there only as good as pizza and wings. Best of all is it is very affordable as I have never thought I paid too much and if your looking for a cheap lunch special, they have it! As for atmosphere, it is very down to earth, no frills, just some beer signs and simple pictures of Napoli or some far off Italian hillside. The exact same group of guys has been there every time I have went and I actually don't know if they ever leave. Every time you see them they are cleaning or breaking down some machine to clean because it took a beating during lunch time. These guys have an awesome \\\"tough as nails\\\" Italian attitude and can come off pushy when placing your order for lunch but for god sake it's lunch time; it's busy, live with it! For dinner, you order it up front and then they bring it to you instead of picking it up from the front and don't worry, at this time the guys are all very gracious. Overall, this place is a classic and if your looking for great pizza in Phoenix; this is your place, if you just feel like something a little better for a pizza to take home; this is your place; if you want a genuine, down to earth experience; this is your place!\n",
      "7 This location is not a nice as the Saint Denis location, but the food is pretty much the same. Chocolate Chocolate and more Chocolate, if you go you must try the chocolate port, port and chocolate go so well together.\n",
      "14 Not the best buffet in town, but definitely cheap. My most recent visit was Sunday night for prime rib dinner. It's pretty cheap especially if someone has a player's card. Our waiter was very attentive and always refilled our drinks/took our plates away. Usually isn't very crowded.\\n\\nThe food is not all that great though. Not a huge selection, and not the best tasting. The prime rib was nothing special. Of course, you probably shouldn't expect too much out of cheap buffets.\n",
      "15 First there was Pepe's Tacos, then there was Tacos El Gordo and now there's this!!  Best part is the restaurant being only a block away from where I live so I don't have to drive all the way up north for damn good tacos.  Located at the former Republic Kitchen & Bar establishment along South Eastern Blvd, this is definitely one of the better looking taco shops out there.  I like how the new occupants kept the same floor plan from the old bar and added few Latin modifications to suit their concept.  Plenty of seats downstairs, upstairs and even outside.  \\n\\nThis place has several stations for certain cuts of meats from which you can order any way you desire: taco, burrito, nachos, fries, bowl, and vampiro.  Salsa bar is also impressive with various sides and 8 different sauces!!  Thirsty? They have a full bar and an extensive list of beer on tap or in a bottle.  Happy hour is from 6-8 p.m. daily with live mariachi on Mondays and DJ spinning on weekends.\\n\\nI always get tacos with cabeza (head), lengua (tough) and chicharron (skin) anywhere I go so I had to try them out from this place.  The first two were quite tasty and really tender.  As far as the chicharron, they actually add crispy pork rinds which was a first since other taquerias normally just serve the taco with soggy pork skins.  What also got me hyped up is the fact that they have elotes since I no longer have to track down this dude who sells them from a shopping cart!!\\n\\nOverall, Taco Y Taco is one of the best Mexican joints in the valley.  I would give them six stars if I could.\n",
      "16 After driving by Chicago Brewing Company countless times, I finally decided to stop by for Ken M.'s UYE last week. In short, the company was great, as was the brown ale. I sampled the Oatmeal Raisin Cookie brew... meh... not my thing. I split the wild game sliders with Norm and Tony (6 for $30) and my favorites were the rabbit, wild boar and bison. Honestly, I can't even remember what the others (alligator, antelope, rabbit/antelope mix) tasted like. It was a week ago, afterall.  If you're a fan of sliders, check it out since they're some of the more unique ones you'll find in the area.\n",
      "20 We have been anxiously awaiting the opening of this  new restaurant.  We went on the second night it was open and we were very pleased!  Service, chips and salsa, food, and drinks were very good!  They have done a wonderful job with the remodel of the interior.  Nice to have another choice in  this area to enjoy - a nice complement to our other excellent Mexican restaurants!\n",
      "23 Last night was my 2nd visit back to this place and I left oh-so-happy about it! I often got this confused with Pita Pit, but the two restaurants are very different. This one you sit down and are served. Both times I went on a Friday night after a movie and it was a little crowded. There may be waiting if there are more than 2 of you, but it's not a long wait if you do. The first time our waitress was good. Last night, the waiter was okay. I'm too busy eating and enjoying the food to really let that part bother me too much. Around 6-7pm last night, it was nice to sit outside on the patio since the sun had already gone down, but if you go earlier, there is shading over the patio.\\n\\nThe cilantro jalepeno hummus is \\\"Ah-mazing!\\\" Don't worry about it being too spicy, because it's just the right amount of spice that balances the cilantro flavor. \\n\\nThe pesto pizza is delicious! We added chicken though which made it more filling! \\n\\nAs other reviewers had said, it feels like everything is so fresh and you don't feel overwhelmed with gluttony once you are done. With the exception of the falafel, not many things are deep fried. Most foods here are grilled or baked. All of the meats and some veggies are marinated, so everything you order is full of flavor.\n",
      "26 Great meal, highly recommend this place. The chef's menu is the way to go. You will not go away hungry!\n",
      "27 If not for the ambiance which was laid back and the wait staff who were very friendly this would be a one star review. Food was bleh. First the coffee was terrible. I took one sip and left it. For a place with coffee in the name I was very disappointed. Most diners have reasonable coffee, not this place.\\n\\nThen when it came to the food it was bland with nearly no flavor. Not sure why there are so many reviews praising the food. Be warned.\n",
      "33 We only went one day for breakfast one day and it was worth the money. Lots of choices and options. So many sweet pastries which I love but it breakfast and it not hard to do. Service was pretty good but its a buffet and you get your own food.\\n We would do this again if we stay at Harrahs again but not sure that will happen\n",
      "46 Not as good as their flagship out on Sahara, but this one's right on the strip, although with the renovation you have to wade thru some dust and scaffolding to get here. The portions were just as monstrously large though, and this time we split 2 dishes among the three of us lightweights, and we left full having not even finished either of them. I'd have picked the chicken and waffles for sure but democracy won out. Here we tried the chorizo skillet and the Tractor Driver Combo. The chorizo skillet was good, although the one tortilla it comes with is inadequate for the amount of filling it comes with. The tractor driver combo we upgraded to a banana pancake which was well worth the extra dollar. Service was excellent. \\n\\nThe experience at their standalone restaurant on Sahara was better in terms of the atmosphere, the food, and the overall experience, but this was still fine.\n",
      "50 This is my second visit to Union Pig and Chicken.  We came back because 6 months ago the food was great.  This trip was very different.  The meaty mac had so much wusabi  in it that it was all you tasted. The brisket looked as if it had been sliced on a slicer then reheated on a griddle because you couldn't see any smoke ring and the color of the interior meat didn't look like a piece of meat cut off a brisket (I live in Texas and know what brisket should look like). There was a lot of fat on the brisket also which is good for flavor but at their prices I would like meat.  On the positive side the coleslaw was very good, along with the ribs.\n",
      "54 Called to make an appointment and told the receptionist exactly what was happening.  She said they can help me and I made the appointment.  I got there at 1:10ish for a 1:20 appointment.  They didn't call me back until 2. Then when they finally did, the PA told me that they don't do what I'm there for. I explained that I told the receptionist why I'm there and her response was \\\"The girl you spoke to is new and she was kinda left a lot for a week to fend for herself\\\"......really?  I needed this test done and now I have to go somewhere for it. If you go here, make sure you are clear about what you need and maybe call back to make sure they do it. I gave up some much needed sleep for this appointment.\n",
      "56 I booked a 3-day rental car for $81.XX and I had my colleague rent the car on the 1st day because I wasn't flying into LV until the day after.  There was a little problem because my colleague is only 24 years old, and he doesn't meet the 25+ rule.  So, for everyday, we have to pay an extra $14 because of that, which I totally understand.   BUT, now all of a sudden, the $81 turned into almost $260!  \\n\\nSo at this time, my coworker is already in LV at Fox, and I'm still in LA.  He has no mode of transportation to the hotel and CES Intl trade show, so I'm worried about him now since I have to make sure he's taken care of until I get there.\\n\\nSo I called and talked to GEORGE (Fox worker) because he was the one helping my coworker out.  I  called in, so I obviously initiated the conversation about the issue, so I obviously have the \\\"right of way\\\" of talking.  But he kept cutting me off while I'm addressing the issue, but I kept talking over him.  Then he flips the script on me, and tells me, \\\"Stop interrupting me, or else I will not talk to you and I will hang up.\\\"  Then I told him, \\\"You're interrupting me, I called in, I'm the customer, let me speak and address what I have to say, can you stop interrupting ME? Let me talk first since I initiated the conversation\\\".  Then he keeps warning me, \\\"If you don't let me talk, I will not talk to you and hang up.\\\" So then, I ask to speak to a manager or supervisor, and he then tells me, \\\"There are no managers/supervisors here\\\", then he hangs up.\\n\\n(This part I wasn't there, but my coworkers filled me in after) George tells my coworker to rent a car for $40/day just for today, then when I get there tomorrow, I will put it back under my name, so this way, we won't get charged too much.  So my coworkers agrees.  Then George said that he has no credit, so he can't rent a car, even though he has money in his ATM/Debit card with a Visa/MC logo.  So George denied my coworker the car.  That was that.  End of story for now. (No other options were given) So at this point, he's stuck at Fox, and I'm still in LA, and can't really do nothing about it.  I'm over 4 hours away trying to figure out what to do. The only thing I could do is to call corporate.\\n\\nSo I called Fox Rent A Car corporate office to talk to HR and I explained the situation. The lady was nice enough to transfer me to the GM at the LV location.  (Wait! I thought there were no managers or supervisors that I can speak to, GEORGE!  You liar!)\\n\\nSo I got in touch with Alfonzo Ruiz, the GM over at Fox LV.  I explained the situation, and he apologized and he said he will take care of my coworker thats been waiting there since he got there, over 3 hours!  Alfonzo informed me that if someone doesn't have good credit or any credit, the only way around it so that my coworker can rent a car is if he provides a return airline ticket/itinerary (Which he has).   This option was never told to my coworker, and all this could have been avoided.\\n\\nI had to call Fox Rent A Car corporate office to get a hold of a GM at the LV location because George didn't want to transfer me to the GM, stating that there are no manager or supervisors there.  Soon as I talked to Alfonzo, he straightened everything out on a phone call that took no more than 2 minutes!  \\n\\nGEORGE @ Fox Rental Car LV - Here are some tips for you:\\n\\n1.) CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT! \\n2.) TREAT CUSTOMERS WITH RESPECT! \\n3.) DON'T THREATEN TO HANG UP!\\n4.)  When a customer wants to talk to a supervisor, they have every right to!  NEVER SAY THERE IS NO MANAGER OR SUPERVISOR.  ALMOST EVERY BUSINESS HAS ONE! \\n\\n-------------END OF REVIEW FOR THIS INCIDENT--------------\\n\\n-------------Another incident from 3 months ago------------------\\n\\nAnother incident, I was at this same location about 3 months ago.  There were about 6-7 workers (possibly including a supervisor), I was the 3rd party in line.  There were 3 parties being helped at the desk, and it was taking for ever.  After 35-45 minutes goes by, the line is now 8-9 parties long, and the original 3 parties already being help, were still being helped!  Talk about slow service!\\n\\nThere were about 3-4 workers that were just standing by talking to each other.  They completely ignored the long line.  I felt sorry for the people behind us in line.  There were open stations or computers and they could have easily helped the line go faster only if they actually WORKED, instead of standing around talking to each other, going to the back room, etc.\\n\\nVERY SLOW SERVICE HERE!  I let this one slide and I didn't post up a review, but after today's incident, I just had to.  I'm never renting a car at this location every again.  All Fox Rent A Car locations have LESS than 3 stars!  \\n\\nNOTE TO CORPORATE:  Implement some training for customer service, work ethics, behavior, etc.  PLEASE!  At least TRY!  Because it definitely doesn't look like Fox Rent A Car cares about consumer reviews, customer service, etc.\n",
      "61 Not impressed by this over priced burger place. My boyfriend and I recently dined here on Easter Sunday. We decided to try it out since it was the least expensive restaurant in the LVH which is where we were staying.  It was empty so we were seated right away. After waiting for about 15 minutes someone finally came over to take out drink order. Keep in mind there were only 2 other parties eating here as well. We ordered food and drinks and the food came out relatively quick. I ordered tangy BBQ chicken wings thinking they would come out cooked in BBQ sauce. I was wrong.... They just came out plain with a side of sauce on the side. The sauce wasn't even BBQ it was actually the honey ginger but I ate it anyways because I knew the waiter wouldn't be back around for a while. After we finished, the waiter brought us our check and charged my boyfriend for 2 beers when he only ordered one. Of course he fixed the issue and we paid our check and left. The food wasn't bad but it is definitely not a place I would recommend. You're better off going to the deli and getting something for half the price that is just as good.\n",
      "62 Okay so it's been almost a year since I discovered their breakfast burrito. The first time it was incredible, but I've noticed that each time I go back, it gets a little bit worse.\\n\\nSeveral times, they've forgotten potatoes or salsa or even cheese in my burrito. It's been poorly or hastily wrapped in such a way that it doesn't even resemble a burrito. Then, when I ask for an extra side of salsa, they give me one of those cups but don't even fill it up all the way. (I'm talking about a spoonful, that's it.)\\n\\nThere's another problem. The salsa is incredibly inconsistent. I get that it's made fresh or whatever, but sometimes it will be red, and other times orange like they put cream in it. One time it even had an odd consistency and it just looked like tomatoes mixed with twigs.\\n\\nMore recently, on Easter Sunday I went there for a burrito and they lost my ticket. So as I was sitting there for thirty minutes (literally, I kept track) with countless waiters passing me by without a word, I wondered what was taking so long.\\n\\nThey finally realized something had happened to it and made it, then said they were going to refund it back to my debit card. I'll admit, I thought that was pretty classy of them... But, it's still over two months later and I never got a refund.\\n\\nThen another time I wanted to see if anything else was better and tried a cinnamon roll. Not only was it incredibly dry and tasteless, but they used peanut butter frosting. It may just be because I despise peanuts...but I don't know... peanut butter frosting on a cinnamon roll doesn't make much sense to me, even if you're trying to be different.\\n\\nI don't care for their staff either, who I feel are standoffish. Won't be going back again.\n",
      "64 I had an inspection and oil change. There was only one guy working alone and he communicated like a cave man. I will not be back.\n",
      "73 We tried this theater for no other reason than it was close and it was playing a children's movie (Mars Needs Moms). I knew nothing about it before we went. \\n\\nUnfortunately, the new spring training complex behind the theaters was not built to include parking for fans, so the Pavillions parking lot also doubled as a baseball parking lot, and it was packed the night we went. There were parking attendants stopping cars heading towards the theaters, trying to charge $5 for parking. When I explained that we were just going to the movies, I got a puzzled look, but he let me through without paying. \\n\\nI don't remember the exact ticket prices, but it was $26.50 for two adults and one child, which seemed about normal for a non-matinee movie. We then went to the concession stand and ordered a small bag of popcorn, two pretzels and two drinks, which totaled $27. A bit on the steep side for my liking, but whatcha gonna do? \\n\\nThe pretzels were frozen and needed to be cooked, so the clerk offered to bring them to us in the theater, which was a first and a very nice surprise. He was very friendly and helpful, and bringing us the pretzels just proved the point. \\n\\nThe theater was very clean, and I really like the renovations they made. I LOVE stadium seating, but the 3-D movies I can do without. My daughter seemed to enjoy it though, so I guess there is a market. \\n\\nAll in all it was a decent experience. I didn't have any of the problems some of the other reviewers had, but I did think that spending over $50 for a movie and basic snacks was a bit extreme. \\n\\nI also tried the demo of the moving theater seats, and I will definitely be avoiding those theaters. I'm sure it sounded good on paper, but it just made me want to puke and in no way would it ever enhance my movie experience.\n",
      "74 Howard the owner can be rude and unwelcoming. The rest of the staff are great.\n",
      "77 $25+tax RESORT FEES per day.\\n\\nEven a motel offer FREE wireless Internet, gym, pool, newspaper, boarding pass printing!  \\n\\nThe low advertised rates are misleading because of the hidden resort fee + 12% Tax on room rates (standard?)\\n\\nSelf parking folks have to walk across the casino to the guest elevator.  I believe every Vegas hotel is designed that way to entice you to gamble...\\n\\nRegarding the room, overall the room looks very nice and modern. I love the goodnight button and electric curtains. Bathroom is spacious, big tub with shower on the side was a plus.  However, the mattress was way to soft, didnt get much good rest because of it.\n",
      "79 2.5...same as Carnival in Rio:\\n\\nHuge selections, our server was such a lovely lady and bottomless mimosa for $27...can't beat that. Plus, we came when there was NO line on a Saturday noon. Wow!\\n\\nSadly...the crab legs are super duper skinny and the baby shrimp (well)...\\n\\nWon't be going out of the strip for this again...\n",
      "86 I switched to Maid to Order expecting great cleaning service due to the reviews. I was not pleased and actually ended up having to follow them around pointing everything they were missing. They didn't dust door frames, ledges, my staircase banister, they didn't move anything so left big piles of dust because they were too lazy to move anything (ie a stack of 5 DVD's...it was all dusty and dirty on the floor behind them. stayed that way). I was promised baseboards would get cleaned...even after I called Judy and she ensured they'd be cleaned, all the girl did was run her duster along them so they weren't cleaned at all. I literally had to grab the girl multiple times and ask \\\"do you guys not dust shelves?\\\" \\\"do you guys not include dusting door frames?\\\" and she gave me a blank look then half hazardly dusted them....leaving dust balls all over the floors that were vacuumed earlier.  On top of that, they didn't vacuum using the extension hoses around furniture or along baseboards...so that was something else I needed to re-do. I was so irritated with the lack of cleaning that was done I was ready for them to leave and had to go through my house and re-vacuum, re-dust....I will not use them again because I do a better job cleaning my own house. Here I thought it would be such a time saver and great help to hire someone to clean for me once a month. But not when you have to go back through your house and re-do everything.\n",
      "90 My girlfriend and I recently visited Kabob Grill while vacationing in Charlotte for the weekend. We ordered a falafel wrap with a piece of baklava to-go for lunch. Both items were good, but the prices seemed very high for dinner and still pricey for lunch. I've definitely had better falafel wraps for less money in larger cities, but Kabob Grill does offer more options than just falafel. There's something counter-intuitive to me about restaurants with high prices located in strip malls, but at least I haven't been disappointed by the food. \\n\\nI can't speak for the rest of their menu, but I would recommend Kabob Grill for anyone interested in falafel wraps at lunch time. The parking situation seemed a little scarce considering we went on a Sunday, but there is more parking available at other locations along the street.\n",
      "92 I did something here that I don't normally do, let alone when visiting Las Vegas. Because I have, like, friends and family:\\n\\nI ate dinner out by myself.\\n\\nSolo diner. Party of one. The Japanese call this \\\"ohitori-sama\\\" - the honored single guest.\\n\\nAnd it was great!\\n\\n* Booking was easy - 7pm weekday reservation arranged a couple of days in advance.\\n* Warmly welcomed by the hostess.\\n* Incredibly friendly, low-key service. Somewhere in between an American bar and a French bistro.\\n* Outstanding food, which needs no further discussion here. For this Californian, though, foie gras (illegal back home, gah) was a standout with crispy seared surface.\\n* Surprisingly reasonably priced, considering Las Vegas. 4-course + amuse menu was $78; before 6:30pm there's also the quick pre-theatre menu for $48.\\n* Got half-bottles of Champagne & Chateauneuf du Pape for $88, which turned out better than ordering by the (relatively pricey) glasses. The fellow next to me ordered a whole Sancerre bottle for $40, well done.\\n\\nWhich reminds me about this fellow seated next to me -- French-speaking Jason Statham assassin-looking guy also eating solo. I was about to happily drown in the French bistro atmospheric cool, until he turned out to be from Ottawa, hockey talk and all, and that rather killed the romanticism.\n",
      "93 Do not use their ATM\\n\\nAttempted to withdraw $ for a bike cab when in Phoenix using my bank's card. Their ATM proceeded to charge me the withdraw amount plus $3 but game me no money. When calling the branch to ask for ATM reconciliation, nobody picks up the phone. If anybody has been to downtown Phoenix during the day, they would know only people at conferences are walking around that section of town so I couldn't imagine who they would be helping. After getting routed to their 800 line several times and being told to only the branch or my bank could start that process I decided to give them the ol \\\"call repeatedly until someone picks up.\\\" After about 30+ tries, I reached a girl who told me only the phone support number could start this process. Explained to her that several agents had told me the branch had to start this process and ask to be introduced during a transfer to someone who could help. Guess what? I was just sent to the start of the 800 menu again. Was not able to reach anybody after another 10 calls, I gave up defeated but still victorious. Victorious in the fact I don't have a bank account with these unresponsive a holes. Would never consider opening an account with any BofA after my experience with this branch and will be sure tell others to heed my warning.  Thank FSM for local banks!!\n",
      "98 You know it's bad when a McDonald's gets a 1 star review...I mean, seriously: none of us expect anything fancy when we go to a McDonald's. The whole point of going to McDonald's is indulging in some not-good-for-you food on the go in your busy life. In my case, I just wanted a small meal/snack that wouldn't cost me as much as the stuff in Kennywood would. I hadn't even eaten at a McDonald's in about eight years or so. And I quickly remembered why!\\n\\nForget the fact that McDonald's food isn't great. We all know it's not great. The problem here is that they added insult to injury by giving you the worst customer service ever in addition to not so good food. For starters, I quickly discovered that the drive-thru here is the ABSOLUTE slowest line on planet Earth. You certainly won't be getting any fast food here! Then, once I FINALLY placed my order, and finally got to the window to pay (because of course I spent a lot of time waiting for the people in front of me to even get their orders), a young woman took my card, swiped it...and didn't say another word. I waited thinking she was printing a receipt - nope! Eventually - after whipping out her phone and sending a text or two - she realized I was still there and told me to go to the next window for my food. Whatever, I figured, forget the receipt; by then I was pretty sure she had moved on to other orders and couldn't print my receipt anyway. On to the next window, where I was given my food and drink...and I proceeded to quickly discover they gave me no straw and for some reason, layered my Big Mac as such: bread, bread, patty, patty, bread. ...seriously, how does one even mess that up? I give one brownie point because the fries really were actually pretty good...but they were not worth the wait or trouble.\\n\\nI concur with the other reviewers: skip this place. Completely. Just keep driving. Anywhere else is better and less of a waste of your time and money, and the people here are so slow that you'll spend more time waiting for your food then you will eating it.\n",
      "100 I don't think this place is as great as they say it is.  It's pretty dirty.  Teachers don't pay that close attention.  Our child went here because everyone we knew had their kids here as it was some what reasonable but since being here, we've found so much better.  It's certainly not worth 4+ stars.\n",
      "104 We came here in hopes of having a meal with our 2 kids and surviving all at the same time, with no dirty looks from strangers. All of those things were accomplished at Rainforest Cafe in LV. The food was ok.. what you would expect. Our waitress was nice, and clearly had experience serving families because she was prompt and attentive to our needs. Its really loud in there and every 10 minutes or so they have a \\\"rain storm\\\" and the fake animals  move and make noise. Its really fun for the kids! It was REALLY expensive for what it is, so I don't think we will come back. But if you come to Vegas with kids (I know.. blaspheme!) then this might be good for a little break in fine dining.\n",
      "108 It feels senseless attempting to use written words to portray the three-day nirvana that was EDC 2012...but here goes nothing!\\n\\nEDC 2012 was my third EDC.This year, I arrived in Las Vegas with two goals: the first, to not end up separated from my crew (which I somehow managed to do not once, not twice, but on all three days of EDC 2011)...and the second, to dive in to EDC headfirst and finish the weekend with no regrets... \\n\\nBoth of these goals were accomplished by leaps and bounds, despite the fact that EDC required my friends and I to bust more missions than I ever considered myself capable of (thanks in no small part to a wallet/EDC ticket/ID/credit card that was stolen on the dancefloor, our befriending of a lovely Canadian girl who had arrived in Las Vegas with nowhere to stay for the weekend, one friend's parents threatening the disownment of their daughter, and a host of other situations that brought my friends and I closer together than ever before). For the weekend to have turned out to be such a RESOUNDING success despite the onset of one shitshow setback after another shows how truly special and amazing of an event EDC is. Anyways, here are my highlights:\\n\\n- Dusk 'til dawn! EDC's most unique characteristic is the festival's \\\"sunset to sunrise\\\" format, which demands as much as your body and your willpower are willing to put out - you'll find yourself with a reversed body clock by the end of the third day. Go for the three-day stretch - you'll find yourself with a newfound appreciation for yourself and the limits of your body.\\n\\n- The talent! Insomniac spared no expense in assembling a world-class lineup of DJs for EDC 2012. In a span of three days, I was able to see Steve Angello, Kaskade, Calvin Harris, Dada Life, Knife Party, and a whole host of the best that electronic/dance music has to offer. Every DJ who played at EDC brought their A-game, throwing down banger after banger and keepin' the party rockin'. I will never forget screaming \\\"This IS Paradise\\\" at the top of my lungs while seeing Fedde Le Grand bring in sunrise with his tune of the same name...nor will I forget hitching a ride atop a VIP cart in the heart of the crowd during David Guetta's \\\"Without You\\\", waving out to a sea of people, all of whom were cheering right back at my friends and I.\\n\\n- The production value, stage designs and lighting effects that were nothing short of world class...\\n\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6NG_A-epYEpsJSugfAaTRQ?select=oKal-wTRBxCJjWzIhcaXig#6sN5BGLpzMnJjYIcjSyt_w\\n\\nEDC fully displays Insomniac's credo - \\\"it's all about the experience.\\\" The Kinetic Field - although not as jaw-dropping as last year's office building-sized structure, was \\\"hollow\\\", in that festival goers were now able to view sunrise through the stage itself. Equally breathtaking were the visual displays accompanying each DJ set; oozing neon colors and trippy illustrations came straight out of (the best kind of) an acid trip. I witnessed dozens of acrobats, costumed performers, fire dancers , and the ever-popular Mirror Man grace EDC with their talents; no details were overlooked in terms of the event's aesthetics. For example, the Red Bull Skydivers glided down to earth, shooting sparks each night...legit.\\n\\nOH, and I haven't even gotten to the fireworks yet. It looks like EDC has prematurely spoiled my 4th of July...\\n\\n- The sense of togetherness found within the crowds at EDC is unlike that of any other event. Because EDC calls for a serious investment of time, money, and energy, there's a filter effect that takes place. Obnoxious assholes and creepy hoodie-wearing tweakers are very much the minority at EDCLV (unlike most massive events held within the SoCal area), and I can speak from experience in saying that the overwhelming majority of the people that I met at EDC were fun-loving partygoers who were very polite (making way for your chain of head-bobbing friends as you navigate a crowd), down-to-earth, and friendly. \\n\\nThis same sense of good-natured behavior was emphasized by the Speedway staff and the Las Vegas Metro PD; when my friend lost his wallet, the police officers whom we asked for help were very much courteous (albeit powerless, as no definite lost & found had been set up...lovely). Did I mention that we hitchhiked our way back to the strip with some awesome Good Samiritan ravers on the first night (due to aforementioned stolen wallet)? EDC gives me faith in the good nature of human beings.\\n\\nI could go on and on, but really you'd have to experience EDC for yourself to fully know just how inspiring and life-changing of an event this is. I didn't really touch on the cons of EDC 2012 (god-awful traffic to/from the Speedway, inept organization with regards to the lost & found, a lack of food options to choose from, Mother Nature giving Saturday night the middle finger), but frankly, that's because all negativity had been erased from my mind for the weekend. For three days, EDC enabled my friends and I to touch the sky!\n",
      "112 Went there a couple of nights ago. Decided to dine in. They seemed pretty busy with take out and delivery and so the service was a little slow. The lady who worked there, owner?, was very friendly and the food was very good. I thought it was better than average American-Chinese places. Portions were big and they used lots of fresh vegetables.\\n\\nLately, I have seen some small local restaurants, that have only one person taking care of everything: answering the phone, taking take out orders, and acting as a server (bring out food, filling up drinks, etc.). I don't understand why they insist in offering service for dine-in. I wish they would opt out of that and let customers order at the register. That would make things so much easier and faster. In addition, customers wouldn't have to wait forever just for the menus to come out or to get a refill. Just an idea...\n",

I feel the prices are on the high side...Yes, I know it  comes with a small salad, bread, a drink (iced tea or milk is included, but not soda....go figure), & a small cup of ice cream, but it still seems a little pricey to me. \\nI felt like the portions are all not that big.  I love the Mizithra Cheese...So yummy! But there were a few times where I felt like they didn't really give you enough on the spaghetti.... I felt a little gipped.  \\nIf you really want Italian Food, then go to Oregano's instead!...NOW we're talkin'!\n",
      "128 my friend and I got free tix from the bellman which was nice. When we got there, 5 minutes late, we were almost turned away until they sd there was a table all the way in the back. We saw two comedians who were funny as hell but no server. \\nFinally, one came and took about 6 orders then five minutes later, the show was over and the lights came on. We took our drinks to go (which were the cheapest we had in Vegas). \\nAlthough the show was only 80 minutes, the server was great and the cheap prices will make me go back.\n",
      "130 It gets 3 stars based on the safety that it is Yardhouse; decent food and great beer selection.\\n\\nI went with a group of 10, ready to stay for the evening....but after dinner we went elsewhere.  The eating area is big and open enough (I actually prefer it to the one in Town Center).  But thats where the good news ends.\\n\\nThe wait staff was slow and inaccurate.  They actually argued that the raspberry beer they brought was the dunkel we ordered.  The manager ultimately agreed with us.  Secondly, but importantly, they have a 1-drink-at-a-time rule.....\\nEveryone knows at a popular restaurant you order when the waiter comes around.  At this particular YardHouse, they will not bring you a beer until the one you have is less than a quarter done.  So now you must wait another 20-30min until the server comes around to check to even make an order.\\nThey let us slide a little because they thought we were a good crowd....ridiculous\n",

Flavorful but not hot (I ordered 3 on a 4 scale, gonna have to try 4 next time ;)  )\\n\\nGood serving size for the lunch special which includes a soda.  $10 including tip.\\n\\nStaff is always friendly and good atmosphere!

      "158 THEY ARE A BUNCH OF SCAMMERS!!!! My husband and I were on our honeymoon!!! We were a approached by a nice lady saying we can give us a lot of attraction tickets for a very cheap price, all we have to do is give 2-3 hours to go to grandview resort too your their hotel and they will provide a free buffet. Sounds like a great deal right?? NOT!!!! We had no idea they were trying to sell us timeshare. We didn't come here to vegas to spend 5 hours!!!!!! on crap, we didn't come here to buy timeshare you idiots!! We came to vegas for our honeymoon to have a great time, not for these idiots to waste 5 hours of our day on our honeymoon!!! We left at 230 and got back to our hotel at 730. We kept telling the sale representative that we had reservations for show tickets at 7. He kept telling us to reschedule. Are you f'b serious??? If\\nYou work in Vegas you should know that show tickets are non refundable. Stupid idiot. We wasted our whole day and all our honeymoon schedule for messed up. I rather pay full price for all the attractions. This was sooo not worth it. The sales representative was also very condescending. We own a home and a business. And we just spent $40,000 on our wedding. And when we told him that and said we don't want to buy the timeshare, he said \\\"I don't believe you own your own home or a business. You can't even afford this timeshare?\\\" F'n idiot. Pls ppl don't get scammed like us!!\n",
      "159 You know those people who keep telling you how great a place is and will not leave you alone till you try it? I suggest telling them to back off LOL or at least I should have in this case. Cheese cake that creamy, dreamy, diet ending evil little creation is what this place \\\"claims to do best\\\". WRONG!!!!!!!\\n\\nOver priced ($7 for a slice) and just not good tasting in any way. The crust was soggy and the filling was like a cross between that jello cheese cake stuff and a box cake mix. Weird! They offer several flavors to choose from but I had the Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake. The banana extract they use reminded me of the syrup from a snow cone. It over powered the whole slice of cheesecake. Also not sure how much sugar they use but it was way to sweet. Bottom line if you are looking for a decent store bought cheesecake try Safeway or Costco. \\n\\nI know they are a chain but this is one of those times were a factory closure would be a good thing!\n",
      "169 I heard about Debbie Downey from one of my stylists who saw a special she was having on endermologie, 3 sessions for $45 each. I have been intrigued by this treatment and have always wanted to try it out. What is endermologie you ask? Well the pamphlet states: the first worldwide, patented, FDA cleared process scientifically proven to reduce cellulite. What I say is....awesome! \\nI have a gym membership that I hardly ever use, it is so hard to motivate to work out when I am on my feet working 6 days a week on average at least 10 hours a day. Now I had been thinking about getting weekly massages to pamper myself and help keep muscle soreness and tiredness at bay. But instead I am now getting the endermolgie treatments because it offers so much more than just a massage. It helps with detoxification, circulation, cellulite reduction, body sculpting, skin tightening and feels like a deep tissue massage. \\nI love it! I bought the first 3 and then bought a package of 10. To be honest though I know it will be a weekly service for me. One of the problems I have been experiencing this past year is my hip joints will start to hurt after so many hours on my feet. Since I have started having Debbie work on me weekly, I don't get that pain even remotely like I use to. I have also already noticed a difference in my body, my hourglass shape is more defined. My stomach is flatter, my skin tighter, my buns are a bit more lifted. A girlfriend of mine gave me a booty slap and said, \\\"Damn girl! Have you been working out? Your ass feels great!\\\" True story.... \\nDebbie herself is wonderful and always works with me and my hectic schedule. I instantly felt her kindness and already consider her not only a service provider but also a friend.\n",
      "171 Majestic Cabinets refinished the cabinets in my entire house. They did an amazing job and the price was very reasonable as well. They were flexible as well when I changed my mind on color in the kitchen. They also have several other references that you can call that all recommend this company!!!!!\n",
      "185 I've been wanting to try Los Taquitos even before I knew it had been on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives and I finally got the chance.  The inside it exactly what I expected, nothing fancy, booths and some tables.  I found it a little odd that the counter where you order is so small and the drink lids, napkins, condiments and plasticware are right next to it.  If there had been a line it would have been very awkward.  I ordered a chicken burrito, enchilada style with rice and beans and a drink.  When I went to get my drink they were out of Diet Coke, it came out as just water.  Ok, I thought maybe they had been super busy as it was about 1pm on a weekday.  Lunch rush perhaps.  I took a seat and waited for my number to be called.  The burrito was good, nothing that knocked my socks off but a decent burrito.  The rice was nice and fluffly but the beans just lacked flavor.  They were blah.  Will I come back?  Sure but I will try the tacos next time and hope that they can rearrange that counter a bit.\n",
      "196 Oh, this Starbucks isn't all that bad.  It's huge.  Lots of comfy seating.  The staff is nice.  They do charge a little bit more.  It's in a casino.  But they charge more at the airport, too, where you probably need it most.  Life goes on.  \\n\\nI'm pleased that they take a Starbucks card.  It pisses me off when casino Starbucks, like the one in the Golden Nugget, won't take the card.  The damn card is the only reason why I go to Starbucks instead of going out of my way for better coffee.\\n\\nThis location is crazy efficient, too.  A little better in my experience than the one by the convention center. It's a good option while in Mandalay Bay.\n",
      "197 This is a fantastic small hair salon. I have been going here for years and they are experts. You always feel valued and always have great service (and a GREAT cut too!).\\nThe ambiance is superb- small, quaint, and not full of egos that you would normally find at a salon of this caliber.\\n\\nI highly recommend!!!\n",
      "198 It's not that bad during their happy hours. The beer deals are pretty good. I tried the yak burger and it was \\\"meh\\\".\\n\\nThe place does get pretty crowded and hence sometimes seating might be an issue. Its just loud enough (so that you don't have to scream at each other) if you aren't in the very back section. The half price wine nights are pretty good too.\n",
      "204 I love this hotel. I have stayed in several hotels in vegas and the venetian has become my favorite after my stay during this past summer. It was the week of EDC so the hotel was packed full of crazy people but I guess that's what added to the fun of this experience. My boyfriend and I came here with a group of friends not for EDC but just for the fun of vegas. \\n\\nOur room was amazing! We got placed on the 38th floor and I loved how the security personnel checks your key card before you're able to go up the elevators. It made me feel safe in a weird way haha. The first thing I saw when we opened our double doors was a baby grand piano, say whaaaat? Not only was there a giant piano in our living room but we also had a humongous I'd like to say 50-60 inch flat screen in the main room. There was a full dining table that seated 8 and our room came with a fridge, and a wine cooler. For the rooms we had 2 full king-size bedrooms each with walk in closets. Each room also had a 4 person jacuzzi hot tub, a stand up shower that had 2 shower heads with a gigantic bench inside it (I'm guessing it's meant for more than one person? lol) an in suite gym, and a dressing room with mirrors all around. We had 2 full bathrooms and one 1/2 of a bathroom. We had a fantastic view of the strip and the water show. We had some fun watching the people splash around obnoxiously down at TAO's pool party too. The bed's were so comfy that I had a hard time getting out of bed. \\n\\nFor the three nights we stayed at the venetian we found the service to be exceptional and by the push of a button we had a bell hop or hotel worker at our door within minutes. Room service was okay, though it's not quite up to par for the price they charge you. The casino's were awesome and I ended up winning $200 the first night woo! The venetian also has a little mall connected to it that's fun to shop. Most major designers (Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Dior, Gucci, Ferragamo, Prada etc..) are available for your interest. There is a food court in the mall that kind of sucks but that isn't the venetian's fault. I recommend eating outside the hotel if you want good food. Come on, I mean, you ARE in vegas!!\\n\\nI had an amazing stay at the venetian and our suite felt like home and I definitely did not want to go back to Cali. I will be coming back in December and I can not wait!\n",
      "219 We went to this place with my husband to see if they had any Argentinean empanadas, or argentinean dough to make them, but they do not have anything Argentinean , it is all Ecuatorian , it is really good food. \\nBut we were looking for Argentinean , anyway is good. I did not like the meat, very spicy , and we Argentineans do not like spicy food.\n",
      "222 One of the best and worst Las Vegas Experiences iv had. Now getting a Michael Angelo Suit with a Pool Table for under $500 a night on a Labor day Weekend last minute sounds great right? Well listen to this story. \\n\\nWe Went to Las Vegas a day early innately staying at the MGM so we needed a room and they were all out we got recommended to this place by someone working at MGM. \\n\\nNow we get there at first scared to go in because it looked like a MOTEL 8 from the outside. But we gave it a shot anyways. We walked in and it looked really cool at first so were like this is better then we thought. We made friends fast with Jen the girl working up front and soon checked out there rooms. The first room they gave us with there standard room which was small but nicely decorated that had a busted door so for security reasons we asked for a room change. Instead of getting a room change we decided to shell out the extra cash and get the Michael Angelo Suit. Honestly it was tacky and looked and smelled like a place a pimp would bring his hoes for a Orgy. But whatever we decided to make the best of it.\\n\\nThe girl who gave us the tour to the room mentioned that this hotel is NON-SMOKING but if u get the suit u can do whatever u want u can smoke there just crack open the window. Like a dumby we trusted her and smoked in the room to only find later  they hit ME with a $250 fee. The room was split between me and my cousin but i got hit with the fee. Then when i called them to ask for my money back they said they would give only half and i said fine. And then i saw my bill they didnt take it off i called back later they said oh yeah we were supposed to take it off but there manager reversed it and that if i want to pay half they decided i should have my cousin pay half of it which i was not going to do..There a bunch of let downs. \\n\\nMy advice is just stay away from this place its shady get a real room at a real place like Palazzo or MGM or Wynn were u can smoke at least and not get hit $250 for a cheep wanna be motel 8 turned into a \\\"LOCAL CRACK SPOT\\\" hotel.\n",
      "224 WTF... half an hour total to get a color match paint in an empty store?  Even my friend got testy with the whole experience (that says alot when a completely uninvolved person is annoyed).  The lady brings the can to the back area, and I hear her chatting away forever, until I start haunting the employee area does the can actually get to me.  And then she forgot to tell them the original formula was 125% strength, which I'm trying to figure out if she did it right.  She snatches the can from me just as I'm trying to validate the old vs new label, and I don't see her again for 10 min... and she never comes back out to tell me if the formula was right or wrong.  I'm just left hanging around w/ no other avail employee (someone else actually walked in)  to at least ask pls followup w/ the lady in the back, who I can still hear chatting away w/ the paint matcher guy.  Seriously poor customer service.  Worst part, they did not mix a new can of paint... just squirted in 25% more tint and slapped another label on the can...chinzy and it was her error.\\n\\nI went to Dunn Edwards (vs my standby) cuz I needed to color match what the original home owner's used, but no screw top lid + poor customer service = not coming back when I'm applying new paint.\n",
      "227 We've tried this place several times in the past few years, and each time that we do, I end up kicking myself for giving it another shot.  I just do not understand the reviews raving about the sushi here!  Once again, the fish we had was of mediocre quality at best.  Maybe I'm just missing something here since it seems like the regular customers are able to command the best quality fish (or at least it certainly looked a lot better than what we had), but the fish just isn't all that fresh and the service is consistently lackluster.  We sat at the sushi bar and literally had to flag down the waitress to get our drinks refilled.  We had some Hamachi and Maguro nigiri, neither of which were impressive and a couple of rolls, one of which was the Negi Toro roll that I had to force myself to eat given the off taste it had.  We'd actually assumed that the sushi chef had forgotten about the Maguro nigiri and were ready to leave, but as soon as we flagged down the waitress, he presented the two pieces to us, nearly a half an hour after the last roll he'd served us when the place was less than half full.\\n\\nI find it strange to hear how many other reviews mention the number of Asian people they see eating here and somehow manage to draw the conclusion from that fact that this is a great place.  That would seem to follow the logic of visiting Europe and seeing a McDonald's filled with Americans and drawing the conclusion that McDonald's is a top-notch American restaurant.  The point here is that not everyone is discerning regardless of whether they are eating their native fare and I find it difficult to believe that this would be considered a quality sushi restaurant among discerning Japanese diners given how much better quality sushi is available in the Valley.  Our last visit to Hiro will be our last and for anyone looking to find fresh, high quality sushi in Scottsdale, I would highly recommend trying Yume at the Scottsdale Promenade.\n",

      "251 Not a bad little golf course location on the west side of Madison (Middleton).  The price is better than other Madison area courses, so if you want to hit a round but not go too far, this is affordable.  \\n\\nIt's an easy course to walk, especially the back 9.  The front has a tough climb from hole #7 to #8, but other than that, there's no reason to have a gas cart (unless you prefer it).\\n\\nCall ahead to make sure there aren't any special outings.  I've showed up on a weekday morning to hit a quick nine and have been turned away for an outing I wasn't aware of.\\n\\nI use the course for my \\\"rebound\\\" rounds.  If I'm not hitting well, Tumbledown is good for my ego.  Most holes you can play your slice from another fairway.  If you're hitting well, you'll be very pleased with your scores.\\n\\nIn summary, while it's not the greatest course, it's an easy and affordable round.  \\n\\nIf you want highbrow golf with a strict dress code and PGA rules, go somewhere else.  Tumbledown is a nice place for a relaxing round or a group outing.\n",
      "256 On Thursday 3/28 I received a flyer from Rosatis at work.  Since we have ordered Rosatis pizza in the past and really liked their product we thought it was nice that they had a location so much closer to us now. \\n\\nHere's why they get 1 star.\\n\\nWe ordered an XL thin crust pizza for delivery and were told it would arrive in an hour and the total was $25.  No problem, that's normal for Rosatis, and quality food takes time.  \\n\\nThe delivery guy arrived on time (right at an hour) and was acting kinda weird.  He seemed nervous and set the pizza on the desk.  We signed for it and said thanks.  He just kinda stood there and looked at all of us (there were three in the room).  I asked if there was anything else?  He said \\\"no\\\" and sort of shuffled out, looking at us the entire time.\\n\\nWe took the pizza into the other room and opened the box.  Now it made sense.  The pizza had been in a horrible collision as if it had been dropped and was like a ball of pizza in the corner of the box.\\n\\nI called to reconcile the problem and explained the situation, expecting we'd get a refund or the next pizza free.  The lady at the other end of the phone said this \\n\\n\\\"um... sorry.\\\"  So I said \\\"ok...\\\" To which she replied \\\"are there any other major complaints?\\\"  So I asked her to get her manager and have him call me back.\\n\\nThe manager called back and apologized and said he'd give us $2 off our next pizza.\\n\\nSo we don't get a free pizza, but if I ever order from that location again I will get a pizza that costs $23.  Thanks for the $2.  I don't think I'll be cashing in on your offer.\n",
      "259 Bachi Burger was recommended to us by a colleague and since it was on the way from Las Vegas, my friends and I decided to stop by. It was so busy that the wait was 45 minutes so we ended up just ordering to-go. But even the to-go took 30 minutes. At that point we just wanted to leave and go home. I ordered the regular bachi burger and it was alright. I wouldn't say that it is a must have. With the price I paid, I'd rather go to In N Out and have a whole combo with a drink and fries honestly. Maybe it was because we ordered to-go instead of sitting down for the meal and having drinks as well, but I think Bachi Burger is just okay.\n",
      "260 The last time and I think possibly the last time I will stay here was not all that great.  We were set up for a room in their tower instead of the pyramid and was glad since we didn't have to hear the slot machines going off at all hours of the night and to smell the cigarette smoke.  BUT, the trek just to find the elevator to the tower sucked.  I generally have a pretty good sense of direction and memorize paths really well but over the 3 days we were staying there, we probably got lost 3-4 times trying to find that set of elevators for the tower.  \\nThe rooms were kind of shabby but good enough if you just want to crash and use a clean bathroom.  We had a side view of the strip which was nice but my fiance and I both agree that it was too far from the attractions we normally would go to (even with that tram...).   We did stay here during the slow season and got a really good deal (something like $100/ person with flight and hotel and some coupons for the King Tut exhibit and some of the IMAX shows) but I probably wouldn't go back if I had a choice.\n",

      "275 Saturday morning and still on the road for another week. It's laundry time. Easy access and Very clean. The nice attendant told me that they also do fluff  and fold for $1.50 a pound. Plenty of machines, wifi, change machine, soap products, TV's, A/C, ceiling fans, carts, folding tables, seating etc. Oh, and if you're a trucker, this place is on the corner and plenty of bobtail parking on the street. I'll be back!\n",
      "276 I was craving something last night and couldn't figure out what I wanted. I happened to stumble across this place and decided to give it a try. I ordered the house fried rice and some crab rangoon. Now the crab rangoon were pretty good and I was actually bummed that you only got four but it was only about $2.50 so I cannot complain too much. The fried rice was just ok. For it to be house friend rice, which comes with beef, chicken, pork and shrimp, I can understand not having alot of the shrimp but it didn't have much of anything. I mean it tasted ok, but I was hoping for a little bit more meat than there was. It was a quick meal considering I didn't really know what I wanted to eat anyway. I may give it another try and hope that it's a little better next time.\n",
      "286 Sometimes the casino cafe is the only choice you have when youre needing food at random times of the day.  Usually when i eat at Studio cafe, or any hotel cafe for that matter, i get the breakfast.  The service here is really friendly and professional, but the food takes a while.  They pump out room service from here too, so i can understand, but when youre starving at 4 am, it seems like forever.  Get the \\\"Grand Breakfast\\\" you never go wrong with that.\n",
      "287 I tend to stay away from clubs in general because when I was in my 20's, I told myself I would not be like those \\\"older\\\" women who still went clubbing.  Unfortunately, I still find myself frequenting the clubs from time to time and just tell myself that 30s are the new 20s.  Yeah, whatever.\\n\\nSo the view is really gorgeous, as stated in everyone's reviews.  My friend's co-worker had a host at the Palms, so we were able to get a VIP table--or maybe all tables are VIP?  Anyways, I have to say that what I enjoyed the most was eat being able to walk past the long line without having to wait to get into the damn club.  There was a two-bottle minimum for our table.  Since we only had four people, we pretty much had one bottle left over.  However, since my friend and I were staying at the Palms, we were able to take it back to our room---one of the bouncers had to escort us carrying the bottle himself and we were able to go down in a different private elevator.\\n\\nThe crowd seemed like your average Vegas bunch---half naked women and drunk men.  Music was okay.  I don't recall the ceiling over the dancefloor ever retracting, though.  The place is pretty big, including an upstairs and two balconies.  The waitresses are pretty hot as well--it was kinda weird having them pour all our drinks for us and stand over our table every so often.  Talk about service....every time our bucket was slightly empty, some guy would refill it...whenever we finished our drink, someone would immediately take the empty glass away and clean the table...the carafes of cranberry and orange juice wouldn't even be 1/2 empty and they'd take it away only to replace it with a full one.  Man, I could get used to going VIP.  I have no idea how much it all cost bc someone else took care of the bill, thank God, but I'm sure it was near $1000 w/ tip if one bottle of Grey Goose is $475.   I doubt I'd go back, but at least I got to check it out once!\n",
      "289 This is a totally A-OK hotel. I was here for a convention next door, and it was quite convienent.\\n\\nFirst the good:\\n\\n1. The rooms are very large for Las Vegas. They have plenty of room to spread out and a nice, big bathroom. The beds were very comfortable and had these great chenille nap blankets on them. Also, instead of those nasty bed spreads they had down blankets, which is always a huge improvement.\\n2. The monorail station is SUPER close to the hotel. At the rest of them, you have to walk 8 miles to get on a freaking train.\\n3. Has a \\\"skywalk\\\" to the convention center. This may be the longest sky walk in the history of humanity, but that little bit of AC sure is a lifesaver in the middle of the afternoon.\\n4. I saw Barry Manilow getting on the elevators one night on my way back from dinner. On second thought, not sure if this a plus or a minus.\\n5. What we ironically dubbed \\\"Asian World.\\\" Its Disney's Asian pavilion from Epcot stuck into your hotel with the world's largest Benihana. Pretty cool, but also deeply odd.\\n\\nNeutral Depending on your Opinion:\\n1. GIANT Barry Manilow poster on the side of the building, Barry Manilow store inside, ect, ect... you get my point\\n2. SO MANY FREAKING LOUD slot machines. So, so many.\\n\\nNegatives:\\n1. Mediocre staff. They don't try very hard, but they don't actively act rude.\\n2. Rooms need some updating. While they are large, the carpets, drapes, ect could have used a freshening.\\n3. Pool closes at 5 p.m.  How does that make any sense??\n",
      "308 My husband and I went here on a Friday night and surprising were seated immediately at a sidewalk table even though we did not have a reservation. Girasole was, as advertised, a very charming cafe with many things to recommend it. \\n\\nThe food was good, but it lost some points with both of us for quality of service and the limited nature of the menu. Our waiter was attentive--until the entrees were served. Then he disappeared. Not only did he disappear but every other server went deaf. They were not so busy that this was necessary. For the size of the restaurant and the number of servers it should not have taken an additional 20 minutes after we had eaten to have plates cleared.  There was a busboy but he was kind of useless. \\n\\nMy husband had the ravioli and I had polenta, both of which were very nice, and we shared a slice of rum cake that was excellent. My suggestion to anyone going there is to look at the online menu first. What you see there is what they will have, period. If nothing looks good it may be a good night to try another spot.\n",

Ooooh lala.  \\n\\nThe girls and I had the pineapple infused tequila shots (I think it is called the House Shot) and it was pretty yummy.  Went down nice and dangerously smooth.  Yes.  For beers, there are a lot of microbrew drafts on the menu.  I ordered a Milk Stout, which was really creamy and tasty.  \\n\\nBut the food...it was mediocre.  I had the corn and cheddar tamale small plate and it was bland.  The sauce tasted like cream, but the tamale itself had no flavor at all.  I also ordered a pork torta and the meat was okay, but the whole sandwich was not great.  It seemed like my friends enjoyed their tacos, so maybe I ordered the wrong thing.\\n\\nOur waiter was cool.  He put up with our drunken cougar shenanigans, so props to him.\n",

Food came out at a nice pace. \\n\\nI dont east sushi so I got a few small items. Started with some Miso soup, super tasty! Then a cucumber salad, it was good but would have loved more onion in it. I also got the tempura vegetables, they were decent but I was bummed that there wasnt any broccoli, also the dipping sauce is a bit salty. Over all though I liked it a lot.\\n\\nIt was a nice little dinner. Would I go back here on my own, probably not. Would I go back here if someone asked me to go with them? Yes.\n",

Since I've only been once I will only give it 3 stars but hopefully will upgrade if I find the other visits just as appealing!\n",
      "353 The Trop is now a Hilton property - a Doubletree to be exact. I'm not particular about where I stay in Vegas, so on a recent weekend trip there I decided to book here since it was on special for 20% off. The rooms are large and the bathroom is spacious as well. I loved that you can open the windows and the fancy shutters on them.\\n\\npros: a separate check in line for all HH members and a separate room for Diamond and other VIPS, separate breakfast area for HH members (smaller buffet plus omelets), cookie coupons (those cookies are damn good), great location.\\n\\ncons: if you're a HH member, the $20 resort fee is a bummer since you'd get those benefits anyways.\\n\\nOverall, if the price is right, this is a great place to stay on the Strip.\n",
      "356 Considering just the food, I have to say that it's really great here. Really quality sushi here. The All You Can Eat menu also includes other dishes besides sushi, such as Calamari or Asian Skirt Steak. The food here is pretty darn great.\\n\\nHowever.... the service here is horrible. I've been here about 6 times and it's a bad experience most of the time. I wait for up to 30 minutes for my food. One time my server forgot to put in anything that I ordered so I didn't get my food for a whole 45 minutes.\\n\\nI also had to wait to be seated for 20 minutes when I could clearly see that there were about a dozen free tables.\\n\\nAlso, one time I went there and the server recognized me from a week before. She remembered that I didn't tip so generously the last time I was there, so when we sat down, she told us \\\"I hope you tip more this time\\\". I believe that was extremely rude. It ruined my appetite for the rest of the meal.\n",
      "359 My never-ending quest for amazing breakfasts led me to Liberty Market yesterday. This place is cool and shiny in a stainless steel, bedazzled, old farmhouse sort of way. The atmosphere is definitely the main thing the place has going for it-- always packed, always lively, new and hip. I also give it props for using obviously fresh, local produce and meat. \\n\\nThat being said, the breakfast didn't blow me away. I got a traditional combo of scrambled eggs, turkey sausage and a blueberry pancake. My date ordered the veggie scramble with a buttermilk biscuit and homefries. The pancake was delish-- super light and fluffy but the eggs and sausage were kind of lacking in flavor. Same went for my date's, though he said the biscuit was the best he's ever had and I'd have to agree. All this, plus their yummy display of desserts by the order counter, leads me to believe that Liberty Market knows how to bake but needs to add a bit of spice to its cooking. If I ever find myself in the boonies again, I would hit this place up (if only because there's not a whole lot of other options.)\n",
      "366 I used GrubHub to order from this place on quite a few occasions.  The food was always bland, pedestrian, but nothing to complain too much about and since they delivered to me, I let it slide. \\nLast night 12/1/2014 my boyfriend and I were having rough days/nights from work and didn't feel like preparing a meal after all the holiday festivities.  So we ordered Thai Hana at around 7:00. I got a confirmation that the food would arrive around 8:00 (which seemed normal). 7:27 p.m. I get an update \\\"Your food is on it's way\\\".  Woah that was quick I think!  8:10 p.m. rolls around, no food. I call grubhub, they call the restaurant and advise me \\\"Food will be there around 8:28, driver is in route to you\\\".  The driver calls me at 8:32 and says \\\"oh man I hit traffic but I'm on my way to you should be there shortly I'll call when I arrive\\\". My bf and I are a little annoyed but honestly, we're understanding people so we let it slide.  Now it's 9:00 p.m. and we ordered our food 2 hours ago, and we are aggitated.  I call GrubHub again, they say they were advised by this location that my food was already delivered. I correct them.  It was not. They call the facility again, they tell grubhub again that they got a little backed up but the food should be there shortly.  9:27 p.m. the driver calls me AGAIN and says AGAIN \\\"Hey I'm on my way I got stuck in traffic I'll be there in 2 min.\\\" 9:35 driver shows up.  \\nFood was cold.\\nFood was terrible.\\n\\nMidnight my bf wakes up to throw up for the next 5 hours, he ended up sleeping in the bathroom until he had to get up and shower and get ready to go to work.  Poor thing.\\nI did NOT get sick, but he looked like a green ghost. My stomach is still a little queasy feeling but atleast I managed to keep my terrible food down. \\n\\nWhen it comes down to it, their service sucks, their drivers suck, their food is sub-par, and somehow it took them 2 1/2 hours to deliver 1 order of Maki Rolls, Drunken Noodle, Curry. and a ginger salad.  On top of that the Maki & Curry made my bf violently ill and the Noodles and Salad made me feel nauseated. \\n\\nWe're done with you Thai Hana and hopefully no one else has to suffer in the future when they order from you.\n",
      "369 It was a type of taco I've never had before, so of course, I had to check it out.  I didn't like how dark the place is, I want to see what I'm eating!  The Pink Tacos were impressive and the excellent black beans put the dish over the top.  I'm glad I went with their namesake because I tried the carnitas and was disappointed.  The salsas were so bland  we asked for their spiciest one.  I don't know what their spice is but it was NASTY so I just avoided the salsa all together.  Washing it down with habanero infused tequila made for a decent meal.\n",
      "374 Ok....I am a picky customer....Not a difficult one, just picky!  \\n\\nAnd from this point on, I will not be staying on the Strip again (unless it's Comp and at the Palazzo or Venetian).  After the initial 20+ experiences of doing the Strip, it's no secret that it's crowded, dirty and for me, way too much on the senses!....Some of you may be able to relate to this??....The novelty just isn't there anymore!\\n\\nAfter 4 nights at The M, I'm officially a convert and it's changed the whole way I'll vacation in Vegas.!\\nRented a car for the whole 4 days... the M was an easy 10 minutes from the airport, near the 15 Fwy and on Las Vegas Blvd, so it was easy to get anywhere. Used the Valet (and they were quick and very affable...even give you bottles of water before you get in your car), which turns out to be about $5 bucks a day..totally worth it!\\n\\nFrom the Valets to the Front Desk to the Dealers to the Waitresses and just the whole staff....service was very friendly and very good.  I don't understand the other reviewers negatives on this?  Compared to the Strip hotels (where there's attitude), it's night and day!\\n\\nRooms were great....Big, comfy, and well-appointed (could've used a Coffee Maker and a Full-Sized Ironing Board).  Bed was comfy too and Bathrooms were great!\\n\\nWe had a Strip/Pool View on the 7th floor.......fantastic!  Pool is great, and uncrowded.  \\n\\nWine bar is great, Marinelli's was a tad pricey but very good (best bread I've ever had), Buffet great...etc, etc!\\n\\nThe whole vibe was relaxing, unhurried, uncrowded and very nice... unlike the Strip.  Free of the tackiness of the Strip!  Great, wide-open Casino floor, Poker room, and Cocktail waitresses (think fake boobs could be an employment requirement, but no complaints?...lol).\\n\\nThe good thing was that with the Rental car, was able to go to the Strip one night, park at the Venetian (ate at the Grand Luxe) and then was able to leave, when we were ready....It was so easy.\\n\\nThen with the car, we went to the Red Rock (which was also great), shopped over there, went and saw Green Valley Ranch, Town Square and other parts of Vegas you'd never see by being locked in to the Strip.  \\n\\nCan go on and on, but think you get the picture?  Rent a car (they're cheap in Vegas), stay at the M and you're free to do whatever you want, when you want and then come back to the very comfortable enviorns of the M....You'll thank me later!\n",
      "384 Been a while since my last Fox & Hound experience so I was pretty stoked for trying the new location (to me) at Northlake.  It is a bit of a haul for me but peer pressure prevailed and I ended up having a decent time here.\\n\\nOur server, Meghan was super nice and friendly.  It did get a bit busy with the Panthers game on a Thursday night - also simultaneous trivia on the same night made for an interesting time.  We didn't stay for trivia but I would have been a little peeved since the game sound was interrupted by the shrill, way-to-excited voice of the woman who runs trivia.\\n\\nAtmosphere is similar to a lot of the other Fox & Hound locations in Charlotte:  dim with tvs all over the place.  The tables in here are very small!  The 4 top we were sitting at was totally full once all of us ordered drinks.   Then the food came out and it was a shuffling, puzzle match as far as finding places to set things.  It worked out though.\\n\\nFish & Chips came out for me with 3 huge, honking pieces of beer battered/fried goodness that a proceeded to scarf down like I had never eaten fish & chips before.  It was nice and crispy.  The fries that came with it were okay - slaw on the side wasn't really anything to write home about.\\n\\nI'd say this is a solid hangout place if you live in the area.  Unfortunately for me, I had a nice lonely 40min drive home to Matthews, but I can see myself doing it occassionally.\n",
      "385 This is my local Chinese restaurant and it's nae half bad. The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside or inside, the interior is pretty naff and looks dated - I would definitely rather eat their grub in the comfort of my own living room. I get the feeling that people don't come here for the d\\u00e9cor though, it's the food that has this place full on a Friday or Saturday night. My sister will tell you that it's the best Chinese in Edinburgh: I don't rate it quite so highly. I always go for the shredded chilli beef and this is a dish that they have down to a tee: succulent pieces of beef, fried until it's nice and crispy then coated in a fiery chilli sauce, mmm mmm mmm. The prices are a little higher than average for a take-away and they haven't realised that some people would prefer them to not use MSG, but all in all the food is quite good as far as local, neighbourhood Chineses go.\n",
      "397 The portions here were very large.  I came here because of all of the good reviews i saw here on yelp and to be honest their ribs were tough their beans way too salty and the mac and cheese was just okay.  This is not a five star establishment the price and portions are excellent but the food is no where close to where it needs to be.\n",
      "398 Disappointed... Went in with a friend, my coffee was quite bitter, and the service was unpleasant. It took 30 min to get our sandwhich while other customers walked out with their food in hand. This is my second bad experience so I doubt I will be returning. :(\n",
      "400 Quaint and bustling place with a great atmosphere especially with outside seating. That said, RELATIVE to all the great food in Las Vegas, the food was not all that memorable. We tried two types of salads and a steakburger. They serve small portions so go if you want a dainty, casual, and somewhat classy meal.\\n\\nThree star does not mean I disliked this place, it's just a measure of how impressed I was relative to other restaurants in the area.\n",
      "404 This was a typical resort restaurant the food was fairly ambitious and the food was pricey. I had the chicken because almost any other entree was really pricey, and almost solidly steak. Never the less the food was pretty good and the service was great. Unfortunately the table next to us lit up and then it was pretty smokey, but we were already done, and we chose to sit outside so that I don't blame them for at all. In the end it was a little too pricey for what your gonna get, some good food but also it was the resort and I wouldn't expect anything different. I probably won't be back, our server was really nice though that's the only reason I feel bad about giving this place 3 stars. Other than that it was all around ok.\n",
      "409 Good food, long wait. You have to give yourself at least 2 hours to stay in line. \\n\\nThe crab legs were great but I thought the prime rib was so so. They have a great selection of food and desserts and everything I've tried was pretty good.\n",
      "410 Good, but not great, see-and-be-seen Joint with a pretentious attitude regarding their vibe/food. Frankly, after all the raves and top tens, I expected more. Blueberry pancakes -- good. Bacon -- very good. Eggs -- runny (ordered over-medium). Fresh fruit -- very good.\\n\\nWhile eating our breakfast, my wife and I were lamenting that we didn't go back to the Daily Dose, one block down. Again, the BC was good, but just good.\\nLive and learn.\n",
      "415 after reading the reviews on here, i must admit that i too was quite disappointed by this buffet. wanting to try this because of yelp, i went here when my parents were off watching a cirque du soleil show.  \\n\\nnothing stood out as being particularly bad, but nothing really was memorable. i liked the idea of marrow, but then i realized it really doesn't have that much flavor. the presentation was cute, with the little plates and pots, but in some cases when i didn't enjoy the food, i felt like i was wasting a ton of food. the pastas in those little dishes were cold and didn't have enough sauce. i also love the idea of a mac and cheese station, but there really were no suggestions about combinations or any really unique cheeses. even the kalbi were super greasy and i feel like i could have made the shortribs better myself. \\n\\nas far as service, it was great. the wait staff was super attentive and always friendly (which is why they get three stars). value? not really worth the 40 bucks you shell out. I would much rather go to the wynn, cravings at mirage or the m resort.\n",
      "418 Being a fan of the $2.99 crispy chicken deluxe, which comes out to $3.87 when I upsize to medium, I made it a lunch stop. It served its purpose by filling me up at an inexpensive price.\\n   On my visit here, the service was fine. The restaurant was also clean.\n",
      "419 I enjoyed the food, I got the chicken fried steak and it came with mashed potatoes and the gravy that comes on the steak. Also some green beans and a side salad that comes out first. All in all the food was good. \\n\\nComing in was confusing. We weren't greeted and since it was our first time there we were very confused. Because it's a cozy place I'm ok with there not being a hostess stand. But I do feel like someone should be on top of greeting the guests so that we know how the waiting works (you just walk in and stand awkwardly at the door and they ask who was there first when they have a table ready.)\\n\\nAll in all it's so so. But I do love that it's a famiky business and the food was good\n",
      "421 So I'm not gonna lie, I was COMPLETELY disappointed with the Encore. My BF and I have stayed at the Wynn twice before and absolutely loved it. Since we had stayed in the past we both have our Red Cards and receive the promotions that come with it in the mail every so often. The last promotion we received was for the Encore and was for $109/night King Suites with $50 resort credit for staying two nights or more. With my BF and two friends birthdays coming up in the month of September the four of us decided to get two suites and celebrate. For months I bragged to our friends about how amazing the Wynn was and that I bet the Encore will be even better. We waited anxiously during the long month between our booking and the actual trip. We get there and are greeted by a beautiful lobby, over the top and so out there it's almost tacky, but it blends together as posh and classy. We are greeted immediately by someone who tells us to please stand in a specific line, though I can't remember what line that was (it was a special line). We waited for quite some time when another person came over and said she could help us right away at another computer. So we provide the lady our info, she pulls up the reservation, 2 suites with one couple in each suite, she offers us the upgrade to the 56th floor for an additional $20-$25 (which was odd because the last two trips to Wynn had upgrades on the house). So we take the upgrade, sign permission for the additional upgrade charge and go to our suites. The suites are beautiful. Love that the TV turns completely around so you can watch it in either the living space or the bed, comfy chase lounge, great detail throughout and, like the Wynn, a gorgeous bathroom. We had a room facing the strip south (beautiful) and our friends had a room facing the strip north and downtown. It started out wonderfully. So we put our orders in for in-room breakfast the next morning, down a couple drinks, and head for the buffet. We have been to the buffet numerous times, and it is our favorite on the strip. We made our friends fans as well. The trip goes to plan, loved the pool, loved the casino, in-room breakfast is always a treat. So here comes check out. We go down stairs and the line is insane. We're talking at least a 45 minute wait. So a gentleman comes by and asks if we would like to give him our room number and an email address and they will send our bill to us right away. I made it a point to ask him should there be discrepancies if we could call back for them to be resolved. He said of course, no problem. So 4 days later (which in Wynn language means \\\"right away\\\") we receive our bill. For $448 more than our original reservation. So I call billing immediately. They only work 8-3 Monday through Friday, which the receptionist called bankers hours. I want to work at that bank! So the next day I call billing and the girl proceeds to tell me that I signed for the additional $100 a night (which came to $400 all together, plus $48 for their 12% tax) in addition to the room up-sell and that in doing that I had agreed to paying $209 a night instead of $109. I nearly lost it. Her and I went round and round and finally she says, \\\"Oh I see the problem, it's because additional people were staying in the room\\\". There were two people in each room. I asked her \\\"Do you really believe I'm going to take a vacation by myself and leave my partner at home?! The average person vacations with their other half.\\\" She keeps repeating to me that this was the reason and that I had agreed to it at check in. I finally asked to speak to a supervisor who immediately knew what the problem was. See, when I made the reservation I asked for 2 rooms for 4 people. The computer supposedly took this as 2 rooms with 4 people in each. She admitted they were wrong and promised me it would be taken care of and I should see the new correct bill in a couple days. Now 10 days later, with no new bill and no activity on my credit card I call back the billing department. I speak to some guy who says he sees the notes in my portfolio to correct the bill, but that no action has been taken on it. I nearly lost it again. I began asking him questions and you could tell through his phone demeanor he was getting irritated that I wouldn't just let him get off the phone and get back to the laughing I could hear in the background. He finally says he'll have to look through the bills to see what he can do and he will get back to me this evening or tomorrow. No call tonight, have a feeling I won't get one tomorrow. I love the Wynn, I really do, but I'm sad to say this may have been my last trip there. They lost an incredibly loyal fan. I hope no one else has to go through the mismanagement of this resort like we did.\n",
      "423 Had lunch here before attending the Dec. Yelp Hours at Cartel down the street.  $6.95 Green curry w/ chicken called my name.  It's a good thing the server took my order before I had a chance to wait much longer- the noise level was driving me up the walls!  Sure, it was during lunch, but I've been here during dinner, too, and even though there were only four or five tables going at that time, the noise level was high.\\n\\nVeggie soup with tofu came in a small bowl.  Lightly-salted, fresh-tasting, perfect to get the juices flowing.  Soon after, a plate with jasmine rice, an oval bowl of green curry, and a small eggroll arrived.  Took a bite of eggroll and was disappointed to see * in the mix.  This is the first time I've seen * in eggrolls served in a Thai restaurant... Thai coworkers tell me that's not the norm.  (Another inauthentic dish served here is their pad woon sen- silver-bean noodles with veggies, tofu/chicken, and egg.  TB serves it dripping with sauce when it should be on the dry side.)\\n\\nCurry sauce was good, but looked too watery and not silky enough.  Medium-spiced, perfectly light.  However, the noise level, soggy pad woon sen, and eggrolls with * will keep me away.\n",
      "424 Saw all the Yelp reviews so I decided to give this place a chance. Plus since we came here as four students out budgets were quite low for dinners and lunch. \\nI ordered the King's Cut Prime Ribs. It came with a salad and mashed potatoes + a free tall (and by talk I mean REALLY talk glass) of root beer/beer. However, the ribs were alright, borderline under the normal standard. The Mashed Potatoes though is SUPER SMASHING. I would totally pay $10 just to eat them. The texture is silky and the gravy is like... There is really no words I can describe it.\\nMy friend ordered a Streak Sandwich, NY Strip and a Pasta and they all came out to \\nabout $100 something for four so that's not bad.\\nOne plus point about this place is that the service is excellent and there are plenty of seats. \\nSo all in all, a great place to eat if you want to pass all the ridiculously expensive restaurants but also don't want to have to resort to the McDonald across the road\n",
      "428 This is a great place to eat and hang out with friends.  I always get the pretzel appetizer and the angry chicken sandwich.  When I am eating them, I believe there is nothing better I could be eating at the time.  I crave those items.  I also enjoy the games there- buck hunter, pool and darts. I recommend this place!\n",
      "433 As a massage chain goes (which doesn't really even make sense because every massage therapist's touch is different, so you can't exactly guarantee the same service no matter where you go), I've always had a good massage therapist.\\n\\nThe membership deal is an interesting idea, not something you can get anywhere else in town.\\n\\nMy only beef is that the massage rooms are too small. My massage therapist was banging into the wall while moving around the massage table. It was a little on the claustrophobic side.\n",
      "444 If you are looking for a clean place this is probably not the place.  Something has to be said about the cooling system (aka the huge floor fan in the back).  The tables are sticky and the bathroom door is black and it is not the paint.  However the food is great and mostly (emphasis on mostly) fresh.  Don't come here if you are looking for a pleasant atmosphere and it is probably better to get your food to go!\n",
      "449 The only thing I would add to the many reviews is that I recommend you study the menu on the restaurant's website prior to going so you understand that this menu is limited and different.  Our group of three had some difficulty figuring out what to order.  I think the idea here is for you to order as a group and share, which can be fun, if you are in to that.  \\n\\nWe didn't like the Mac and Cheese with lobster very much.  It's a different twist on this old standby.  We were surprised at the very little piece of lobster you get for an extra $4.  It's not worth the extra money.\\n\\nOther than these quibbles it was good food and a nice, but small place.\\n\\nThey only take reservations for groups of six or more.\n",
      "454 Some of the poorest customer service I have ever experienced, but the crepes and drinks were very good :)\n",
      "455 Not the juiciest pho and rice dish in town...\\n\\nThe pho was ok. Definitely a lot better than the rice dish. I got the rice dish with pork and the shredded beef with the egg. It was not good at all. The pork was charred and a little hard on the burned part. The egg didn't have any taste. The shredded beef was not good. I did not even like the fish sauce that it came with. The service is slow. The prices were ok, it's not cheap.\\n\\nThe pho soup was pretty good but I've had better. I did not really see the praises that people gave for this place. I thought it was below average quality hence the 2 stars. .It's not the worst food I've tasted but it definitely was not great. \\n\\nThe parking was easy to park so that was good. The visit was just very whatever. Nothing to remember it by or no reason to come back again.\n",
      "464 A very nice dinning experience.\n",
      "482 okay we went here last year and to be honest were a little disappointed but not as much as we would have been since we had a heads up from a driver on the Duece bus.   No this is not a big zoo and to be honest you really cannnot spend a full day here like we tried to do.  That being said it was still fun.   We enjoyed the talking birds and the other exotic animals they had.   The place could have been cleaner and there is very little in the way of food options so eat before you come.   We were sitting inside and learned by listening that they often hire kids doing community service to work around the place.  I am sure in part because of lack of funding.   Its not a bad place just that you would expect much better in a city the size of Las Vegas.   I still enjoyed the time we spent there but to be honest not quite sure it is worth the cost of admission.\n",
      "483 I am there at least twice a year and I go there everytime and the staff are really friendly thats what we need these!! KEEP IT UP!!!!!\n",
      "486 First timer to Josie's! I was in the area on my lunch break running errands. I was wanting FroYo but didn't know of one in the area, but I did know there was a Jamba Juice so I was going to settle for that when I saw Josie's and got excited! Never heard of it but was worth a shot!\\n\\nFirst impression when I walked in. It's smelled! It smelled like cleaning products which you think would be a good thing, but it smelled more like a public restroom smell with an aroma of cleaning products! Not to mention it was hot!! On a 90 degree day I expect to walk into a froyo shop to be cooled down. It was hotter inside than out. I tried to let that pass and continue with my craving for froyo.\\n\\nI got mango, watermelon and coconut. The mango was Extremely watery. The coconut was the most tasty. Then the watermelon then mango. I usually like to get the fruit flavored froyo and top it off with all fruit topping. What the heck!!!! They only had two slices of strawberries!!!!! Extremely disappointed again!!! So I ended up topping it off with two slices of strawberries, different boba balls, white chocolate chips and some peanuts. Very unsatisfied!! Not only that I don't think the labels of their topping are correct! I got what I thought was white chocolate chips, turned out to be yoghurt chips??? I don't know. \\n\\nOverall I am very disappointed. I won't be returning. So glad yogurtland is opening up near my work soon!!\n",
      "487 I went to Rice Paper once. It was different. i liked the smallness of this place, and for that they totally owns their cuisine. With that said, it is a bit different for the neophyte to the characteristics of the Vietnamese kitchen. It has different smalls, suttle tastes and sometimes present consistencies that the Western eater aren't ready for. \\n\\nBut this shouldn't discourage the adventurer. The food is good, and it isn't that hard to stay on a meat free path. The service have room to improve, but I shouldn't venture there.. I seem to be a privately owned business, so I should let them run this place as they see fit. But even so, I wasn't blown away - however, I will return and give this place a second chance. \\n\\n.. und das ist nach der kritiker\n",

      "506 I realized on New Year's Eve that I had done some terrible planning on my part and may not be able to get in to get a mani/pedi before my trip to Mexico due to most places being closed on New Year's Day.  I woke up early and headed to the closest place to where I was house sitting in hopes to beat the New Year's Eve rush.  I was able to get right in here at Paulene's.  Hannah was very friendly and did a great job.  My pedi is just now starting to look as though it needs freshening up (2 weeks have passed).  My mani started to go after a week, but I also spent a lot of time in the ocean during that week.  My only issue with this salon is that you cannot add a tip on if you are using your credit card.  I never carry cash and always use my check card.  I had to head to the atm afterward to get cash for Hannah.  I wonder how many people just end up not tipping because of this.  Be sure to bring cash before you go.  My basic mani/pedi was $40 before tip.\n",
      "514 Hubby got comped rooms. But we decided to pay extra $10 a night to upgrade to the GO rooms that is recently renovated. The bathroom is up to date with a tub and shower. We got a double bed room. Apparently the old rooms didn't have the coffee maker and ridge, which is one of the main reasons why we upgraded since we had our little girls with us. Our room over looked the strip, and the biggest highlight was.... It was facing the water show at the Bellagio!!! Got to see the water show for only $10/night extra compare to the $300+ / night in the other hotels! \\n\\nCons:: very small room. And the carpets look and probably is dirty. Guess they didn't change the carpet during the renovation.\\n\\nStill a very old hotel do can't really blame them with the old outdated rooms and hallways.\n",
      "515 I have mixed feelings about this place.  For a place called Stripsteak, is it supposed to shine for the dishes that were non-Steak?  I went shamalamadingdong over the duck fat fries and truffled mac and cheese, but how can our steaks that we made at home the following night shine over the Stripsteak steaks?!  Huh?  Allow me to illustrate....\\n\\n1.  Trio of Duck Fat Fries - These were mutha beepin' good!  Loved the bbq flavor fries.  Loved the garlic flavor fries, and most of all, I mutho beepin' loved the truffle fries.  These blows Envy Steakhouse's out of the water (not that ENVY had a chance with their truffle fries anyway).  Let me just call these my Crack Fries.\\n2.  Sashimi (albacore, bigeye, blue fin toro) - The worst decision ever.  We were greedy and thought that \\\"Hey, we're at an expensive restaurant.  It has to be good right?\\\"  Boy, were we wrong!  The albacore was icy?  WTF?  The tuna was fishy.  AND.  AND!  The toro was so fibrousy.\\n2.  Bibb Wedge (Salad) - Standard blue cheese, iceberg and bacon.  Yum.\\n3.  American Kobe Ribeye - Good but not juicy.  (Del Frisco's and N9NE still win)\\n4.  Slow Poached Prime Rib - Not juicy, not super tender.  *tear\\n5.  Truffled Macaroni and Cheese!  - Another mutha beepin' good one.  Trufffleeee.... *pump fist.\\n\\nConclusion:  I beepin' loved the fries and mac n cheese.  I will dream of them.  However, the steaks, I will not have, again.  I say save yourself the disappointment, don't go to stripsteak and make it yourself.  I gave them only 3 stars because of the disappointing steaks.\n",

      "527 I Went here with my girlfriend last week for dinner, and I wasn't to impressed. The waitress was nice and accommodating but the food took forever to come out and there was only a couple other parties in the restaurant. When we finally got our food my girlfriends chicken was still raw. The waitress took it off of our bill and she sent it back to finish cooking. A little while longer it came back fully cooked. It did not have a lot of flavor but at that point we were just happy the food was there and it was safe to eat. I wouldn't recommend eating dinner here, but it is a good place for desserts.\n",
      "534 This place is awful!!!!! I've been going to Firestone for yrs all over Arizona. Never ever had an issue until this location!!! Messed up my appts 3 times in one week. I've been here a total of 4 times this week!! Refused to top off all my fluids. Never heard of this before. It's your job!!!! When asking for my keys back, he refused. Then I asked the guys in the garage to give them to me and the GM told me \\\"to stop being crazy!\\\" Excuse me!?! No. Never coming back here again!!! They will screw up everything!!\n",
      "538 I go here because it's close.\\n\\nYellowtail collar is strong. Fish is fresh. Only thing I don't like is that the rice falls apart too easily. That is kind of a big thing when it comes to sushi.\\n\\nWould I go here again? Sure, but I definitely would drive farther to go to a better place.\n",
      "543 Another comp dinner and this time I was sober enough to remember that indeed, we did not eat that much. (I know, what do you expect from a complimentary dinner, right?!) eh =/\\n\\nWe were provided a salad which had an oil dressing that I was not loving, not a balsamic dressing, just an oil.  And rare steak over rice which was just okay.  Drinks were still on point and service was still great.  Still looking forward to going back for an actual dinner to provide more details but isn't their comp \\\"tastings\\\" supposed to entice you to come back??  Well, based on that theory, I may not return. =(\n",
      "545 *This Review Is For The Business Office Only*\\n5 weeks and one day after my wife dropped an online class, we are still fighting with CPCC to get our refund. My wife has made multiple phone calls only to have one returned. It seems her refund is setting in cyberspace. They want her to get her refund by activating a CPCC debit card, which they get a kickback on, and which is no good to use anywhere other than at CPCC.\\nMy wife explained that she is almost finished with her degree and will not be attending CPCC again, therefor, does need or want a CPCC debit card, but just wants her money refunded by a check or put back on our debit card. The girl in the business was not very helpful, but kind of rude and snippy, and said she would have her supervisor call my wife, which as usual, we are still wating on a return phone call.\\nNot only did CPCC take an $85 fee out of our refund for \\\"not dropping the class in time\\\", but now we are having fight to get get the remaining amount of the refund.\\nWhen she signed up for the class they took the money from our account that instant, but now 5 weeks and $85 in fees later, we are still fighting to get our refund.\\nThere should be some kind of law to prevent this, but since there is not that is why we are going through this to try and get OUR money that CPCC owes us.\\nWill post an update when and if this gets resolved, but after what we have already been throught with CPCC, I'm not holding my breath for an easy or fast resolution to this problem.\n",
      "551 Finally broke my Bacchanal Buffet virginity, and I'm sad to say that this place has been over hyped.. Or maybe I just had too high of a standard for this place because of everyone's reviews about it. \\n\\nMy family and I went during dinner - around 3pm, so there was almost no wait time. Walking in, I thought this place was quite impressive. The decoration was beautiful. I've never seen a buffet decorated like this! \\n\\nWe got seated, told the waiter our drink order, and left to get food. \\n\\n--- 1st serving: \\n\\n- Lo Mein noodles: Pretty yummy. Just the way I love my Asian noodles to taste like! Noodles weren't dry and it was pretty flavorful. \\n- Salmon Nigiri: Can I just say.. YUM?! The salmon was nice and buttery. It tasted so good and fresh! But can I just say that the rice tasted TOO vinegary for my liking.\\n- Kalbi ribs: Ehhh... Taste was yummy and very bbq-y BUT the meat was rubbery :( that killed it for me.\\n- Edamame: Pretty good; wish it had a little bit more flavor to it though.\\n- Penne alla vodka: HOLY YUM. I wish I got more of this, but I wanted to try bits and pieces of everything before I got insanely full. \\n\\n--- 2nd serving:\\n\\n- Oysters & crab legs: Mmm, my favorite seafood ever. So good! Though I wish the crab legs were a bit more meaty though. The ones at the Carnival buffet at Rio had more meat and were a bit more flavorful than the ones here.\\n- Beer-battered shrimp: Not my favorite.. And I LOVE BEER. I was expecting these to taste like heaven but the shrimps were too overcooked so the meat stuck to the shell. I don't know about you, but I want to eat ALL of my shrimp meat.\\n- Cocktail shrimp: I prefer the ones at the Carnival buffet better. Sure the shrimps here were ginormous but the flavor was not.\\n- Corn on the cob: BEST CORN OF THE COB. HANDS DOWN. \\n\\nAs for the dessert, THIS WAS MY FAVORITE PART! It was like every single item I got was a little part of heaven going into my mouth. So good! \\n\\n--- Service: I thought the service was poor :( They took forever to get the plates off of our table. Not to mention they also failed to refill our drinks. I don't know if I'm spoiled or what, but I like it when my server is pro-active. They see an empty glass, they refill it. Simple as that right? I don't have to sit in my chair for an extra 5-10 minutes just looking around and waiting for ANY server to pass by just so I can get a refill of my peach iced tea. I understand that they get busy, but don't neglect your guests in the process of that for 20 almost 30 minutes sometimes! \\n\\nAnyway, I would go back.. If I won the lottery. This place is WAY TOO overpriced. $200 for 4 people for Saturday dinner. Yeah. OVERPRICED. When I could go to Carnival buffet for HALF of that price AND eat amazing quality foodies!\n",
      "560 This place is just OK... Not terrible and not great. The food is good but you will not find anything on the menu that is heavy and greasy. It would be nice to have something crisp and light when it is 105 degrees outside. Also the atmosphere is pretty good... It is really more a BBQ place than a bar.\n",
      "563 This pub seems to me like it would have been a lot better had I arrived earlier.  When I got there, there were tons of people and no tables.  I went upstairs, and the service was pretty slow... She took about ten minutes to take our drink orders despite the fact that we were standing at the bar looking like we needed drinks and doing the finger-lift thing occasionally when she looked our way.  Instead, she was chatting.\\n\\nAnyways, like I said: a lot of potential, but it didn't pan out when I went.  Maybe if I make it there again, it will be better and I can update this review!\n",
      "566 WAIT WAIT WAIT.......... 5 stars for food and beer only @ the BBQ restaurant next to the brewery...\\n\\nOK, Ellis Island is a dump of a casino, it looks old but it has three things going for it...........BBQ baby back ribs, BBQ chicken and onsite brewed beer. They cook the ribs in the parking lot as you enter from Koval.\\n\\nThey brew their own (multiple beers). $1.75 for an 20 ounce glass...... And they make (non alcoholic) root beer too............... I'm hooked on the lite beer.\\n\\nOK, here is my humble opinion. I can drop a $100+ bucks easily on myself for dinner at the right place 7 days a week if I wanted to. I just wanted to be clear that I'm not cheap.\\n\\nEllis Island was mentioned to me about two years ago and I finally went in June 2011. I'm not a fan of BBQ because I don't like the mess and usually the lack of meat on the rib bones. You WON'T have that problem here. For $13, you can get at least an 18 inch+ rack of baby backs, (BBQ beans, slaw, bread and corn on the cob very average). You can also get a rib/chicken combo. There is a pizza place within spitting distance that serves great pizza by the slice that you can bring to the table (our appetizer).\\n\\nI CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK........... And I'll get two racks of ribs next time because they were that damn good and cheap.\\n\\nBEWARE, IT'S POPULAR, SMALL AND THERE WILL BE A WAIT. SO DRINK UP!!!!\\n\\nFYI, It's behind Bally's to the east.\n",
      "573 Went last night for a late dinner around 10pm. The service and ambiance were great. I loved the entertainment. The food was pretty good except for my lamb. I ordered it medium rare and it came out well done. It was the worst lamb I ever had.\n",
      "578 I be been here for lunch and dinner and the food is great. Not huge but still a very good selection with great present. They have a beautiful selection of desserts as well. Steamed crab legs are the best!! The food overall is a bit salty but still my favorite buffet on the strip so I have to give it 5 stars!!\n",
      "585 Just came back from Vegas.  And I almost missed my flight on my way home so I just need to warn other people here about Gray Line.\\nOn Jan 17, I made dozens of calls to reserve my return and the line was always busy.  Because I couldn't wait in line for more than 15 minutes.   kept calling from 7pm until 10pm.  Finally I got back to my hotel room and reached someone after 45 minute phone waiting.\\nOn Jan 18, the scheduled driver didn't show up on my reserved time and I was waiting at chilly hotel outside with my cell phone for 15 minutes to reach the dispatcher.  And she told me the driver would need another 10-15 minutes to come.  When I told her their driver would be half an hour late, she was very mean to say it was only 15 minute which was normal.\\nEventually the driver still didn't come at next 15 minute and I was almost giving up because the time was so close to my flight time.\\nBefore I went for the cab, there was another Gray Line bus dropping some customers to my hotel from airport.  The driver was initially refusing to pick me up because I was not in his schedule.  After begging with him with my almost flight, he was finally willing to pick me up to the airport with few more stops of passenger pickup.\\nThere was only 15 minute left when I rushed to gate and fortunately caught my flight.\n",
      "588 Atmosphere is awesome...the menu items..and taste \\\"eh\\\", service...maybe cause it was a slow night they have less staff on hand. But had to go to Bar to get our drinks, which were advertised half off during happy hour...and was charged full price. Concept is good, just need to work a bit harder on service and food\n",
      "592 Food was ok, maybe a step up from dennys with a nice selection. I do have to give props for the service though. The server was excellent and the manager, who I overheard talking to the couple in the booth next to us, was bending over backwards to make them happy so the place really seems to want to make their customers happy. So in a nutshell ok food with good service at decent prices. Can't recommend but I might give them a second shot.\n",
      "601 On our first night getting into town, my buddy and I were pretty exhausted and didn't feel like venturing out to find food on the Strip, so we swung by America after getting out stuff up in the room. Not really too much to look at - typical diner-style restaurant with a lot of American maps and ethos painted on the walls. We came in pretty late when it was empty, so we just slipped onto a couple of the bar stools at the front. The beer selection is pretty standard, but not expensive, and the liquor selection is quite extensive. I ordered your standard breakfast - eggs, bacons, toast, etc. - as a late-night snack, and it came out pretty much as you'd expect. In all - a decent place to grab a bite within NY-NY, but nothing more than that.\n",
      "602 While throwing a small get together, we were able to have a back patio with a buffet style table set up with some pretty tasty appetizers.  The chicken sqewers were delicious and smoked salmon was also tasty but something seemed to lack.  At the end of the day it was good and I wouldn't hesitate to go back, but nothing to make me a raving fan.\n",
      "603 I don't even have a fork!!!!  It was between courses and I started to yelp about just how down hill this place has gone when I looked up to see - they hadn't even given me a fork when they brought my entree.  OMG - terrible service, horrendous food, they were out of nitrogen for the special drinks they gave us a nitrogen drink menu for, out of garnish for the specialty drink I ordered, they were out of meatballs for the meatball pasta they offered my husband, the drinks finally arrived after the meal - our neighbors were incredibly disappointed too.  I used to love this place!!!   What the hell happened?   Such a disappointment.\n",
      "606 Carbs, carbs, and more carbs......this is a horrendous place to eat.\\nSteer as far away from this place as you can. \\n\\nMinus five if allowed.\\n\\nFries on a crummy beef sandwich.\n",
      "608 My ny strip was very tough! Thought my knife was dull, but it was not. Would not come back!\n",
      "611 First of all, I'm just glad I didn't pay to go in here. My girls were lucky enough to skip the guestlist line and not pay. The decor is nice, sleek and clean. But aren't all the decent clubs like that. I have no way to describe Vegas clubs since they look all the same to me. \\n\\nThe venue is SMALL though. This can be a good thing and bad thing. If your surrounded by pervs and nastiness, your pretty much stuck. No where to run and hide. Luckily, I saw me some eye candy the night I went. And close proximity within eye candy is always good. \\n\\nThe major down side is that there is no outdoor smoking patio. And if you know me, no patio = no fun. Hey, a girl needs fresh air and a hiding spot at least once the whole night in a cramped tiny club! I need ventilation baby ventilation!\n",
      "614 Cargo, \\\"cavernous cargo\\\" I call it. I popped in a few days ago with some colleagues and had my ears blasted with hip hop, mainstream chart music, you name it the dj played it whilst also running a quiz. Now that's multi tasking....\\n\\nThey were trying, I'll give them that but the clubby type atmosphere they were trying to generate did not sit well with all the suits milling about. \\n\\nI think I will keep my visits to Cargo restricted to rugby days....\n",
      "615 Keep in mind this isn't AC or Vegas.  That said, rivers is pretty nice for what it is.  There are some drawbacks sure, but it does well.  It's laid out nice, has a good selection of table games and slots.  The card room is always has games and the tournament structure is pretty good.  They have lots of free giveaways and plenty of promotions to keep you coming back.  The food is good, the better being Andrews steakhouse and the buffet.   Protip - the champagne brunch is really good. \\n\\nThe cons?  To start, drinks on the playing floor should be free.  There's no hotel.  There's nothing really live or upbeat.  Friday and Saturday nights should have live bands, dancing, and be really uplifting.  It just doesn't happen here.  It's pretty much all about the gambling.\n",
      "630 I've came here a couple of times. Nothing special here, just another big name franchise. You can tell they try to cater the younger customers. Never been a big fan of this franchise, but will come back to try something new or meet up with someone? Food is usually salty and not much flavor. There is a lot of other options out there for you to try instead.\n",
      "633 the experience was fine - good wait staff, ambiance, etc.  on to the food:\\n\\nstarted with the Ricotta Ravioli which was solid, but not spectacular.  I guess I expected more, but who are we kidding - I came here for the steak, not the starter. \\n\\nsplit the Chateaubriand - the cut was (as usual) fantastic and the medium rare, while a bit overdone on the bottom, was still tender and delicious.  it was not over-salted or over-spiced, so the flavor of the cut really came through.  the roasted garlic was a great touch and added a great flavor.  these guys do steak proper - worth the price of admission.\\n\\nfor sides, the wild mushrooms were fine...and the mozzarella/whipped potato side is nothing to write home about.  don't get either...try some of the more adventurous sides (marrow, piquillo peppers).  \\n\\nin all, a fine meal.  but as a Chicagoan, a lot of folks can do the steak right...its the starters and the sides that really make a steakhouse stand out.  on both of these fronts, i either chose wrong or they just don't put too much into it.\n",
      "644 Went with a group of friends, the beer selection was very good, the appetizers were also good.\\nWe went in at happy hour, $3 off all beers.\\nWe could easily view multiple games at the same time and being able to go out on the deck with the view of the Monte Carlo pool.\\nOur server, Jose, was great, funny with a great sense of humour  and quick wit, and very well  versed on the menu, especially the beer. \\nWe will definitely return on our next Vegas trip, and hopefully take in the much celebrated duelling pianos.\n",
      "646 A group of friends and I decided to try this place out since we were in the neighborhood. I figured this was going to be a super packed biker bar for a Saturday night. To my surprise, the bar was relevantly dead. There were some couples dancing, and a few open seats at the bar. We ponied up to the bar, got some large PBR's and some shots. The bartenders are a bit half of Hooters, bit half of Coyote Ugly. The mega-phone antics got annoying real fast. That is probably the only thing I really hated about it. They had a photo booth in there which was only $3 so my friends and I were all over that!\n",
      "647 4.5 stars. I'd like to give Tea Infusion 5 stars, but I can't. I blame the location, for this refreshingly cool place gets lost among the retail stores at Tempe Marketplace. Tea Infusion would be a great off-the-street place to go. I can see it situated in the LGO or Central/Camelback Ave or Biltmore area. Or even tucked neatly off Mill Ave. If it were in any other place but Tempe Marketplace, I'd become a regular - especially because they have free wifi.\\n\\nI ate lunch here today with a friend. We both commented on the striking decor - the soothing blue/gray walls and dark wood. There are even a couple of quotes painted on the walls, along with vibrant art hanging on display. \\n\\nTea Infusion also sells tea cups, mugs and tea pots. But is that really why you'd stop in? No. You'd stop in to sample the tea, check out the menu and wager if you'll like this place. At least that's what I did. \\n\\nI like this place quite a bit, for the tea selection is large. From black to white to chai to oolong, you have many possibilities to satiate your tea appetite. I ordered a hot pot (two cups worth) of their chocolate mint chai. I also ordered egg, cheese and ham on an english muffin (from their breakfast menu, which is served all day). The tea arrived shortly with a little orange hour-glass, which is used to tell me when the tea is ready (3 minute seep is standard). Once the sand fell down to the bottom, I poured the tea into my glass. And I sipped. It was just the thing to offset the chilly afternoon. \\n\\nMy sandwich arrived later. It was just okay. I nibbled on it happily, though. My friend ordered the Tuscan chicken sandwich, which came with an artichoke sort of tapenade and a small splattering of goat cheese. She said the multi-grain bread was delicious. We both encountered a small problem though: our sandwiches wanted to fall apart. A piece of mine even leapt from the table onto the floor. Messy. \\n\\nBeing one of the few patrons there, we were able to relax, slowly drink our tea and enjoy a free-flowing conversation. Then it happened. A fresh, organic fruit tart appeared and we just had to have it. My friend quickly jumped up to order one for us. In order to make room in the display case, the girl behind the counter offered up a sampling of some chocolate truffle-like dessert. I gladly snatched up a sliver for us to try. And then we melted into the pleasures of fresh, organic fruit on top of a sweet custard surrounded by a flaky crust. There was also the bliss of the chocolate treat. \\\"This would be absolutely perfect with coffee,\\\" I said. My friend agreed, for the chocolate dessert was the perfect amount of cream and cocoa to complement a cup of hot coffee. \\n\\nI would recommend this place for a brunch or afternoon escape. While the lunch menu does offer up sandwich and salad options, I think you'd do better sticking with the obvious: the tea.\n",
      "649 I can now say I've dined at Ruth's Chris and I can also say that I just don't get the hype.  The food was fine, no complaints.  But for the price I expected a really spectacular meal and I got an ok meal.  \\nI got chicken and my husband had the filet.  Again, no complaints about the food but we felt we could get what we had at a lot of places.\\n\\nThe service was good - We had reservations during restarurant week and I was impressed that we were seated almost exactly on time based on how busy they were.  Our server was fantastic and attentive.  \\n\\n\\nTo Sum up - not a place I would return to.\n",
      "650 Really clean, friendly place. The prices are very fair and they don't try to jerk you around with up sells. On this particular day there was a misunderstanding with my oil filter. It ended up taking an extended amount of time, but they apologized by comping the service! Nowhere else would ever do that. Certainly would recommend for all of your car service needs.\n",
      "652 Slowest Starbucks I've been to.... Unfortunate because this one is a convenient location to where I live but the drive through always takes 10-15 minutes whether there's 2 people in line or 12.  People very nice and friendly but not effect enough for how quick Starbucks is elsewhere\n",
      "660 5th buffet in 7 during the Buffet of Buffets adventure.  This buffet has a good variety of food.  They offer a miso soup machine, which I enjoyed.  It dispenses the soup nice and hot and then you add as much tofu, kelp, and green onions as you want.  It was pretty tasty and that is a compliment given that this was my 5th buffet of the day.\\n\\nI haven't been back here in years and the renovations that they did are really nice.  They have a booth in the VIP section that has a fountain running through it.  It's hard to explain - you just have to see it.  But it's pretty cool.\\n\\nThe staff will make Asian dishes fresh for you.  It's called a teppanyaki station but it's more like a Mongolian grill setup to me.  You fill a bowl up with vegetables, noodles, ginger, garlic, and other things.  Hand it to them and let them know if you want shrimp, chicken or beef.  They grill it up for you.  It was ok.  I would do this vegetarian next time.  The shrimp tasted nasty - like dirt.  But the veggies were good.\\n\\nOne of my pet peeves with buffets is that they sometimes make you hunt for condiments.  This buffet has this issue.  The butter was not by the bread.  I had to hunt around and I think I found it somewhere in the salad bar.  \\n\\nThe line was pretty long when we got there at 3pm but we had line passes so we skipped that.  If you get seated in the VIP section, you can get champagne until about 4pm.  I'm not sure about the regular seating area.  Decent buffet, but there are better ones in town.\n",
      "664 The good:\\n- children get a magna doodle to draw on, \\n- the wait staff is very nice, \\n- the restaurant is very clean - it's brand new, so that's expected,\\n- the pasta selection is basically \\\"create your own\\\", with 5(?) types of pasta (incl. whole wheat) and at least 5 types of sauces (incl. rose), plus you can add toppings to your pasta\\n- karaoke Fri+Sat night,\\n- the food tastes decent,\\n- prices are decent, if you don't add extra toppings,\\n- unique desert menu\\n\\nThe bad:\\n- the kids menu is on the back of the magna doodle, but they don't tell you that, and it's small\\n- kids' drinks come in an adult sized to-go cup,\\n- it took them almost 10mins to clean up (my daughter's) spilled milk\\n- the menu consisted of pasta, pizza and paninis, not much more,\\n- pasta toppings are $1.50 each,\\n- my canneloni (desert) was pretty bland.\n",

      "667 I was hosting some friends for a Mexican themed dinner and realized I had no dessert! I quickly yelped \\\"dessert\\\" in my area and this bakery was the first listing. It is less than 2 miles from my house and the reviews highlighted tres leches, which was perfect for my theme! \\n\\nI popped in at about 5 and although they were out of the big tres leches cakes, they had two smaller sized ones (smaller size = enough for 1-2 people)  that I picked up along with a tiramisu cup and a cream puff. All of this for under $20! Nice! :) \\n\\nOnce dinner was over, I took these babies out of the fridge and my friends all did this: O_O. Saying the tres leches cake was a hit would be the understatement of the year. Although there were only four of us, I'd be willing to say that if I had bought the actual standard sized cake version, it probably wouldn't have stood a chance. It was delicious, moist, flavorful, rich, sweet, and perfect. It was all you'd ever want in a tres leches cake. \\n\\nThe cream puff and the tiramisu were standard for these desserts - no worse or better than most others I have had. But, WOW, that tres leches was special. \\n\\nAlso, they have a wide variety of cupcakes and these little ball cake things that look amazing and truffles and such. I will be back to do more sampling ASAP!\n",
      "681 It seems un-American that I've never mini golfed before... so I'll say my visit to King Putt was my 1st time mini golfing in probably the past 20ish years. &, all in all, it was super fun & I'll definitely mini golf again. That said, here's my critique of the venue... Upon pulling into the unfamiliar shopping center, just about everything stood out but King Putt; it's dark & unwelcoming. A mini golf joint or anyplace cosmic should make you question if you can handle the fun on the other side of the door, before you even open it. In this case, I was worried about leaving my nunchucks at home- I started to fear I might need them. Also, the sole employee on duty was pouring a bucket of water out. It doesn't matter why- it didn't seem appropriate & gave a trashy vibe... Upon entering, the glowy cosmic'ness & the excellent music made me giddy. I liked that there were a couple groups ahead of us & one behind us but that it wasn't super crowded. The golfing was a good time but one of the courses was rigged with a big ol' ladder- again, kinda trashy. & I'd almost immediately started coughing- I think from the paint. & it was pretty dang warm- I think from the blacklights. The air just seemed stale- as soon as we left, it was cooler & my cough subsided. Upon leaving, the employee seemed happier to see us depart than when we arrived.\n",

      "707 Visited here on August 4th. I have heard about Maizie's for a few years and thought we would give it a go. Upon arrival, the young lady at the front desk was pleasant, but there was certainly no smile coming from her. I think the greeting one gets when coming to an establishment sets the tone. \\n\\nWaitress was very nice and very helpful. I think she was the bright spot of the evening. \\n\\nFood, I must say was mediocre. I was disappointed - maybe I had my expectations too high. I had some buffalo chicken dip - served with chips and a piece of pita bread. Chips were stale - disappointing. The dip was ok. The waitress told us that people come from miles around for the dip. Not sure why. Luckily we were there during happy hour time and got the dip for $5. had I paid $9.50 (regular price) I would have been really disappointed. \\n\\nHad a burger with sweet potato fries. Again, it was OK. But nothing you can't get elsewhere. I  think they should toast the buns (Ciabatta bread) as the juices from the burger and moisture from the vegetables on the burger make the bread get soggy very quickly. Toasting the bread would have gave it a bit more structure and would have held up better. \\n\\nWill I go back? Maybe. Maybe not. All was OK - but nothing really stood out.\n",
      "711 This is like a cafeteria, no extravegant decor in the dining room or food display.  They did have some variety for brunch, including breakfast, lunch, pre-split crab legs, asian food, meats, and a nice dessert section.  However, it still felt like a cafeteria, it's not like the surrounding competition, kind of disappointing since they are the newest hotel, I guess I was just expecting a little more.  Especially the walls in the casino and through out the hotel was so intricate and unique...I just thought it would be a unique experience...turns out it wasn't that great and unfortunately I believe that other casinos have more to offer as far as buffets go.\n",
      "725 Great food and good service as well. Happy hour daily from 3-6! Definitely put it on your sushi list.  Recently tried additional items and will be sticking with the Sushi only...\n",
      "727 this really isn't the best pita jungle out there. the food is great, but i rarely get my food the way i order it. servers are kind, but seem overwhelmed during lunch - often we get our food and don't see a server again until we're ready for our check. i can't give them less than 3 stars because i really, really like the food, but i wish it would come to me the way i order it more often.\n",
      "735 The wife and I stopped here for a bite and beer and was surprised. The steaks we ordered were huge and very tasty. Overall good beer selection and great service from Robin made foe a great evening.\n",
      "737 I never been to Sweet Tomatoes despite being extremely close to our house. Every time I drive by , it looks packed. Today I went with a friend and my son for lunch. I had a coupon, it was 20 something including drinks for both of us.  The drinks are definitely overpriced, the buffet at less than $8.00 was a decent value. I agree with a previous reviewer, the toppings for the salad were very basic, kind of disappointing. To their credit, everything looked and tasted fresh. The prepared salads were good, I'm pretty sure very high in calories as well. I had the potato leek soup, which was nothing to write home about. But.... this month they have chicken pot pie stew, you pour this on top of a biscuit and that was sooooo gooood. I'm surprised I liked it since I don't even like chicken pot pie, but the stew was nicely seasoned, the veggies were good and the biscuits were light and fluffy. Comfort food at it's best. \\nThe breads were OK, and the muffins were tasty. The pasta didn't looked appetizing to me at all, except the mac & cheese that my toddler devoured. Granted, at this age I don't think they're the best judges of good food, not to mention mac & cheese is a group food on its own for them.\\nThe fruit section was very sparse, only whole apples and pineapples slices. \\nIn general, unless you eat a lot, buffets are not a great value but a $10 lunch here will leave you satisfied, if you're not big into meat that is. I know that I need to come back for more chicken stew and biscuits.\n",
      "752 Great food,great atmosphere and view. Very good service.\n",
      "753 Giving 2 stars only because MOST of the staff were friendly. \\n\\nI had booked a room over the phone some time in advanced and specifically requested for a smoking room after the concierge offered a choice. When I arrived to check in I was asked if I wanted a smoking or non-smoking again, just to be told all the smoking rooms were booked but \\\"to make up for it\\\" the concierge told me he would put us close to an elevator so we could get back to the lobby to smoke. Got to the room which was indeed close to an elevator but had an unsightly view of rocks on a rooftop and green lights. \\nI asked the concierge at the information desk if at any point I could switch to a smoking room and she recommended that I call during checkout the next morning to see if anything became available. \\n\\nMy fianc\\u00e9 and I are chain smokers so we didn't spend much time in our room. At one point my fianc\\u00e9 forgot the card to the room and was locked out for an hour as I was asleep because he needed to go to the lobby to smoke. One staff member was kind enough to give him his phone so he could call me but I was out cold.\\n\\nI called at 11 AM and nothing had opened up. I called again about an hour later and the gentleman was kind enough to offer to call as soon as a room became available. I called again a little over an hour later because we needed to meet with family and I had no intentions of spending my vacation playing the waiting game. The concierge told me there was nothing she could do for me and from what she was saying it appeared there was no note about giving me a call as soon as a room became available.\\n\\nAfter spending time with family and touring the strip I came back to the information desk  hoping a miracle could happen and a room became available. The was a glimmer of hope as I saw her write down another room number, but after speaking with the housekeeping manager she told me nothing was available. \\n\\nI don't understand why an establishment would even offer a smoking or non-smoking option while booking the room if nothing is gonna be available. When I book a smoking room, I would hope a smoking room has been saved for me when I check in. Are those rooms just on a first come first serve basis? If so, why even tease the guest by offering it while booking the room? I also find it hard to believe that out of the several hundred people that checked out, no smoking rooms became available at any of the times I called.\n",
      "759 For car service, I will definitely recommend Generosity Limo. I needed a ride to the airport...at 4:00 in the morning! I had no options, and this was an important trip. I contacted Generosity, and Dave was very accommodating. He told me it was his pleasure to get me to my destination and that I should expect my driver on time. As an infrequent traveler, I was nervous about being on time because of all the stories you hear about airport security and how much time it takes to get through. Also, I live about an hour from the airport. \\n\\nI wasn't quite ready to go yet at around 3:50 a.m. when I got a knock on my door that startled me. The driver was early! The car was nice and clean, comfortable, and a smooth ride. The driver was professional and seemed to really care about getting me to the airport on time. I enjoyed the ride and arrived safely with plenty of time to get through security and wait for my flight. Because of my trip to the airport, I believe my trip to Michigan was stress free and very enjoyable.\\n\\nI would recommend Generosity Limo for anyone who needs car service!\n",
      "761 Let's talk food.  Started with the wings and they were very good.  Ordered the ribs for dinner.  They were not so tender and the flavor is just not that great, to me. The cole slaw fell flat.  No zest, no zing, flavor just not so great.  The fries were great.  Husband ordered the Steer Here sandwich and said it was pretty good, but he also was not a fan of the slaw.  Atmosphere was good but we left before the live music started.\n",
      "764 Do you like walking...a lot...in heels...up and down a buttload of stairs? If you do, this is thee place for you! Lol There are three floors and you go up and down a ton of stairs to get around. Usually you can find some space to dance, but it was pretty tight. Outside patio area was nice, but hot as hell. It didn't feel that hot if you were outside walking around on the strip. Just no air circulation or something. There was a loooong line at about 10pm when we got up to the club. Super happy our large group got pulled up to the front and no cover. Score!\\n\\nThe bouncers were pretty rude as some others have mentioned. The dance floor \\\"closed\\\" about 30-1 hour before the club. That sucked. Two of my friends made it down, but all of a sudden the bouncers arms started pushing people back. You don't have to sound like a dick to get your point across.\\n\\nWomen's bathroom had a decent lounge area with mirrors to primp. Didn't have to wait in any line to peeeee! (Girls you understand what I mean).\\n\\nHad a great time with my girls, but will opt out of returning. (It says 2 check-ins, but I've only been here once).\n",
      "765 Ok. Let me start off by saying that Tuesday's are the BEST day to come here if you want a cheap, not so fast, meal. $5 burgers -&- fries/tots (circa $5.38 w/ tax). This is why it automatically gets 3 stars. The downside to this is that their demand + quality = unsatisfactory @ times. They started making the burgers (meat portion) all \\\"well done\\\" which allots the burgers to become dry. I personally like mine medium-rare because it remains juicy and is not overcooked. The tots/fries are a hit/miss depending on 1) party size & 2) the number of customers ordering. This also has an effect on the overall service. When I was there, the waitress messed up over half of the orders because she did not write it down. When I did get my food, the tots were basically croutons. My burger was on the point of crumbling into dust b/c it was so dry (and I added ranch, ketchup, and a fried egg was on it). The drinks are definitely overpriced. They are located by UNCC, so they should absolutely lower the prices for drinks for students. The actual venue is set-up nicely, but it was extremely cold and the waitress did not know how to adjust/turn-off the ceiling fans (or didn't even try for all I know). Overall, the price for the burgers + fries/tots is worthwhile, but how they handle customer volume needs to be more embedded in their training program. O_o\\n\\n********************\\nUpdate 11/19/2014 - Bar Louie is now making you buy a fountain drink if you get the $5 special. Therefore, your bill is now roughly $10.00 w/ tip included. I went there for the $5 burger + tots, not for a freaking soda. I will not be back here for a while because of this peculiar & random add-on. Thanks Bar Louie for ruining the special. I will not tell anyone else about you guys! o_O\n",
      "768 Revolving sushi bar?! This is highly dangerous for self-proclaimed sushi addicts, like myself. The concept is genius! You sit down, wherever you want, an as sushi goes around on a conveyer belt, you pull what you would like to try. You pay by the plate and the plates are organized by color. So before you even pick it up off the conveyer belt, you know how much it will cost you. At the end, they stack up your plates and bring you your bill!   I'm going to break it down to the good and the bad. \\nThe good: if you're in a rush... You can literally sit down and just go to town, there isn't much of that waitress lag, so if you work at desert ridge, this is a smart stop for a lunch break. They have a decent variety of rolls and sashimi that goes around the conveyer belt, even desserts, salads and drinks. The waitresses were attentive and made sure to refill our waters without us asking. \\nThe bad: the baked rolls revolving around weren't very fresh tasting and kind of soggy. My boyfriend explained two ways to avoid this: 1. Go during the dinner rush since things are selected more quickly. 2. Pick the boxes with condensation on the inside of the lids, they seem fresher.\\nI guess the third way would be to order directly off the menu, but that seems a little less fun. \\nThis place does need to be updated, decor wise. It's got modern style paint with strange paintings of waterfalls, and flowers.... And Disney characters? What? \\nAnd another thing, wipe down your tables. They're gross looking. \\n\\nI'll still be back, but probably during a busier time, just so I know the food is a little fresher.\n",
      "770 I used to like Famous Dave's a lot more than I do now, but it's still an alright place. I think I am done ordering the burger here, because it is not very good. Their BBQ has been pretty decent though and their service is usually up to par, which makes a difference.\\n\\nIt's not a place that I am overly excited to keep coming back to, but I am sure I will be back someday to see if they can impress me yet.\n",
      "779 This is a little on the old side but something happened last week that made me have to write this review.  Back in August, I went to Josh to talk to him about something I needed his help with, a bad tattoo someone else did!! I asked him if he could help straighten it out of he said, of course, no problem.  So, I scheduled an appointment. When I got there for my appointment, all of a sudden, there was nothing he could do to help me with my original problem (which was my ultimate goal).  He actually worked on another tattoo for me, again, one I wasn't concerned about. \\n\\nJust last week I went into Double Down Tattoo in Glendale and talked to them about the very same issue I discussed with \\\"Josh\\\".   David at Double Down said he could help and he did exactly what he said he would do and I could not be happier with the work David did.   Double Down has talented artists and very friendly staff.  The do excellent work for a very fair price!!\n",
      "783 J'aime bien ce petit resto. Je ne dis pas que c'est le meilleur, mais il a beaucoup a offrir pour les petits budgets. La soupe est correct, non pas mauvaise, mais pas la meilleur de Montr\\u00e9al. Par contre, les grillades et les saut\\u00e9s, j'adore! Plusieurs choix \\u00e0 moins de 10$ et aussi plusieurs choix offert en combo. Je ne conseille pas vraiment d'y aller en groupe...ce n'est pas un jolie endroit.

      "785 Food was ok the burritos come with just meat nothing else. So if you order the chicken burrito you are going to get a tortilla filled with shredded chicken. Their floutas were good I would go back for them especially with their salsa.\n",
      "787 Holy salty food, Batman!  0_o\\n\\nI had dinner here on Friday with my husband and toddler daughter.  It was packed, but not nearly as packed as the other restaurant that we attempted to visit and left because there wasn't enough space for us.  We waited in line for a few minutes and finally it was our turn to order.  I shouted my order to the employee on the other side of the counter; over the deafening din of other people who were talking and eating and all the kitchen noise.  It's very noisy when that place it busy!\\n\\n I ordered 2 enchiladas with the 50/50 flour/corn tortillas and the short rib for the filling.  I chose green enchilada sauce and cheddar cheese as my topping with some Pico de Gallo and buttermilk dressing.  For my little I got her a carnita taco with a side order of the saut\\u00e9ed spinach and mushrooms and some of the same buttermilk dressing on her taco.  My husband ordered two enchiladas: one was spinach and mushroom filling and the other a cornbread filling.  He had the red sauce on his enchiladas.   At the register I added on a grapefruit margarita and a fountain drink for my husband.   We paid around $32 for everything.\\n\\nThe inside was packed, so we ate on the outside patio.  The patio was also very busy and every table was taken so we could only find seating at the counter that runs along the face of the patio wall.  It was difficult to keep a toddler perched high atop the barstool so that was a bit of a challenge, but the twilight temperature outside was really perfect so some of the hassle of sitting out there was worth it.  \\n  \\nMy grapefruit margarita was very tasty, but the food is a different story.  I like salt, I use a good deal of it in my normal cooking because as a Sonoran desert dweller we need it in our systems to survive, but I can hardly remember a time where I'd been to a restaurant and the food was so over-salted that I couldn't finish eating.  That was the case on this visit, my husband complained of the same thing, despite the fact that he was eating a completely different kind of enchilada than I was!  Our toddler only picked at her food too, I suspected it was also the sheer saltiness of it.\\n\\nThe buttermilk dressing on my enchiladas and my daughter's taco was outrageously salty, the green enchilada sauce across my food was crazy salty, the short rib filling was heavily salted and I think there was even salt in the Pico de Gallo too.  Seriously, whoever is in the kitchen at Gadzooks NEEDS to step away from the saltshaker, the saltiness of everything overpowered the different flavors of the dishes and it was over the top.  \\n\\nI'll try this place one more time and if that visit goes poorly then I'm done.  This is my second try to understand what everyone else sees in this place.  :/\n",
      "788 We decided to stop by this place because we felt like continuing our sushi quest yesterday, it was close, and it has good reviews.  I wasn't expecting a whole lot, however, since it was the East Valley, and the first thing I noticed was the lack of an actual sushi bar and visible sushi chefs.  Plus, there was techno music playing.  I HATE when they do that.  Sorry, but I want an authentic experience, complete with Japanese dudes chopping up my fish in plain sight, and 15th century Japanese music with pan flutes and hand drums or whatever they use.  A samurai trained in the bushido tradition standing by the door in order to slice up unruly guests would also be a nice touch, but I'll give them a pass on that one.\\n\\nAnyways, we sat down at the table, and started with the miso soup.  This was some of the strongest miso I've had.  It was almost like they were trying too hard.\\n\\nSo, I wasn't real hopeful, although they had some nice cuts of fish on the menu... Halibut, toro, uni, etc... Nothing crazy, but still some good stuff.  Unfortunately, they were out of all the interesting stuff.  The live specials were only available on weekends, and by Monday, they were all out.  Cool that they have them, but unfortunate that we couldn't actually try them.\\n\\nI also wanted to try the beef tataki sashimi style, but for some reason, it was only available in nigiri.  Why?  You can put a strip of seared beef over rice, but you can't serve them alone?  This did not make sense to me.\\n\\nWe ordered a couple of the special sashimi items - some hamachi dish whose name I don't recall, and the Screaming \\\"O\\\" - as well as white tuna sashimi, albacore sushi, red snapper sushi, surf clam sushi, and the Sixty Nine Roll.\\n\\nThe hamachi was overly stepped in citrus.  I mean, it was so citrusy that you were basically eating lemons with the texture of raw fish.  I'm the kind of guy who likes to taste fish when he eats fish.\\n\\nThe Screaming \\\"O\\\" was pretty good, despite its overpowering spice and marinade.  Also masked the tuna flavor, but it was a seared dish, so it wasn't as bad.  It would have been better had they dialed it down a notch, but it was still tasty.\\n\\nThe sushi and sashimi was typical.  Basically what you'd expect from a standard sushi place.\\n\\nSixty Nine Roll was pretty good.  It is basically softshelled crab and shrimp tempura on the inside and fish (I believe it was the standard tuna, yellowtail, and salmon) on the outside.  Good filler to finish off the meal.\\n\\nFinally, we ended with some tempura ice cream and tempura cheesecake for dessert.  The cheesecake was nice and thick, but also pretty much frozen and impossible to cut with a spoon.  The tempura batter was all wrong; it was thick and crunchy, not light and flaky like tempura is supposed to be.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, I decided that this place is good for what it tries to be.  Its appeal is not for those who love sushi.  It's sushi for people who probably like to eat at Chipotle, Zupas, or whatever the newest trendy chain place is, but every now and then want to eat some raw fish.  It has enough to perhaps expand the horizons for those who don't often eat sushi, but not much that will interest those who like a new adventure every meal.\n",
      "797 It is so nice to have a frozen yogurt place so close to the house.  I can get there and back in less than 5 minutes which makes the frozen yogurt craving at the last minute much easier to deal with. \\n\\nThe best part of Poppy's is the friendly and professional service.  Everyone that I have ever interacted witth there understands what \\\"hospitality\\\" is.  That is something you do not see in teenagers and young adults these days.  \\n\\nThe only reason that I did not give them a 5 star rating is that they do not have as many flavors as some of the other frozen yogurt places do.  HOWEVER, what they do have is fantastic.  \\n\\nThe bigges plus to Poppy's outside of the staff is the heated hot fudge.  Wow it is to die for.  \\n\\nThe shop is always clean and I always feel comfortable there.  \\n\\nI have been there on several occassions and will keep coming back, no doubt.\n",
      "798 I can certainly appreciate the higher-starred ratings but feel that I must consider all factors.\\n\\nThe good:\\n-Fresh, innovative drinks with fresh ingredients.  Whole pineapples are cut, lemons are zested, simple syrup is made, liquor is infused with fresh ingredients. This is all very good stuff.\\n-Service (in my experience) has always been friendly and helpful.  Both times Jim G. and I went to this bar we had a buy one, get one free coupon and the servers were still kind and helpful.\\n\\nThe not so good:\\n-It's a circle in the middle of the Palazzo.  Thus, there is no ambience whatsoever.  It's not closed off, separated from the ringing machines and badly dressed tourists. If it were, it might feel cooler. If it were, it might be justified to pay so much for a drink. As it stands, it's hard to do it when you can get free drinks (not good ones like here, for sure, but free) from the waitress 5 feet away.\\n\\nAs long as they have a 2 for 1 deal, we'll grab a drink. They're strong and tasty, but I wouldn't just sit here and buy drinks. You decide =)\n",
      "807 By far the BEST place for ice cream.  Make sure to stop here.  Amazing ice cream and great service!!!\n",
      "808 I'm really not big on malls at all.  Maybe it is just how bad Concord Mills is, but maybe this is an OK mall if such a thing exists.  I had a coupon to get a free coffee from Border's cafe so I had to find the nearest one.  I was glad to see that this mall was bright and new looking.  Seemed to be a good range of standard and faux upscale stores like Guess and Sephora (not for me :P). It is a real pain to get in and out of the parking lot.  They have everyone channeled into a small narrow entrance.  Better go during the off-peak hours or get good and cutting people off and making illegal u-turns.\n",
      "811 I've been here for breakfast and lunch.  Being a breakfast fan, I appreciated their food.... this place does get super busy on Sundays though - If you have time to burn I'd definitely check this Mint Hill spot out - not if you are in a rush though!  \\n\\nI had the Popeye Salad (spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, I opted not to put the feta cheese on and put baked salmon instead with a balsamic vinaigrette).  Good size and taste... the salad was definitely more rustic in that most of the veggies were very rough chopped (if at all) so you get big slices of mushrooms and halves of roma tomatoes - I didn't mind at all.\\n\\nService was nice, but they got so busy when they had a lunch rush our server didn't come back to check on us - we weren't needing anything else but refills so we survived.\n",
      "815 I like the Sands properties since their shows are constantly rotating, bringing something new. The people who produced the Beijing Olympic ceremonies also produced Panda ! So the basic story is Long Long is on a journey to save his Peacock Princess from the Demon Vulture who kidnapped her on their wedding day. \\n\\nIt's got a little bit of everything: stunts like balancing on stilts, acrobatics, kung fu board breaking and sword work and traditional Chinese dances from the long sleeve dance to some fan dancing. I think the costuming was done very nicely and the stage was nicely used. The one thing is the whole back wall is used to project various landscapes and since there are steps and such in the back in certain angles the projection didn't look like it lined up right. The musical score I think was welldone and made sense with the story, though it would have been lovely to see more live music since Chinese culture has such awesome traditional drumming and unique instruments like the huqin Overall though it was lively and pretty show. \\n\\nThey try to interact and make it fun for the audience. Before the show you can find the pandas wandering around the lobby for pictures. During the show, they've thrown out various trinkets, pulled little kids to dance in the aisles with them, throw streamers onto some people, had big panda beach balls being thrown about during a staging transition. Between the theme, the bright staging and the audience interaction I would say this would be a good family friendly show choice. It seemed like there was a high number of children watching and seemed to really be enjoying themselves. \\n\\nNow I know that the main draw IS the panda characters, but I feel mixed about that. So the pandas are the only ones in full on fuzzy animal suits and other animals are more people with wardrobe that was made to interpret a animal. So there were moments where it's supposed to be sad or tense and I just couldn't muster up the feels for him since the panda was such a caricature of himself. He's supposed to be shaking in sadness and crying when he lost princess peccock, but his big head is just bobbing in a way that was funny and not helping the cause. In the picture I posted of the show, you'll see how it's a serious scene with everyone else on stage and then....there's a kawaii little panda in a suit and top hat. \\n\\nAnd of course, the story line sounds a little stolen from Kung Fu Panda. I absolutely loved Po, but the animation and the fact everyone else is animated made that more congruous. I'm sure it's a love/hate thing and some people may absolutely adore the fact it's a panda and part of the point is that it's fun/funny. \\n\\nOverall, I still enjoyed the show and appreciated the variety and a different culture it brings to the Vegas show lineup. Definitely if you are a parent, this would make a great family night. Or if you are a rice chaser, as I saw a lot of those there too.\n",
      "821 Took my grand kids for first time at this location. Where I come from they skate, not here. Order took a long time, beef way undercooked, fries blah, chick strips not good. No one liked anything...server looked stoned.\n",
      "826 I tried going here for groceries for a little while and the store was always clean and there was definitely always a lot of eye candy shopping here, but Safeway is kinda pricey... especially compared to the new Walmart Neighborhood Market that just went up down the street, and I've never checked out at this location without having to wait in a line.\\n\\nI also had a bad experience here a few weeks ago. I wanted to run into a place and grab some light beers, and just happened to be driving by Safeway and thought \\\"what the hell?\\\" So I go in, grab a 6-pack of O'Douls (yes... non-alcoholic beer), and as I'm checking out the 5'2 Indian lady behind the counter (I think her name was Betty... something with double-consonants and short) claimed that my ID was fake! I'm a slightly over 6' and had plenty of stubble that day. \\n\\nBetty went on to have me repeat EVERY single line on my driver's license. Even after which she said, \\\"You are not 6', you look around 5'8.\\\" This came from a lady who barely came up to my chin. When I told her that was ridiculous she actually made the claim \\\"this is not your ID\\\", from which I started producing my credit card, work id (with photo), and school ID (with photo), which she stared at for 30 seconds while turning over trying to prove they were fake, then grunted and sold me my non-alcoholic beer... all while still acting as if she felt I was some sort of hooligan!\\n\\nWhen I asked Betty what her problem was, she said that the night before they had been \\\"raided\\\" and her co-workers were given thousands of dollars of fines, and she didn't want to be fined. I understand that sucks, but it is not acceptable to make that interfere with your customer service and make customers feel like escaped prison convicts.\n",
      "827 If I could give Meineke ZERO stars I totally would because they are sharks!.  So I hit a curb (this is a regular occurance I don't know why) and I needed to get a front end alignment so I thought.  I brought my car to this Meineke because it was close to my house and driving was getting pretty difficult.  When I called before I went over there I asked how much the alignment was and it was in the ball park of $90.  Ok, sweeet!\\n\\nNo, not sweet.  Sour.\\n\\nThey said it would take 2 hours JUST TO LOOK AT.  So I went over to Bilbo's and hung out there for a while.  Exactly two hours on the dot they call me to go back to Meineke.  They gave me an estimate of $1400 (no effing way) and said that my car was basically going to explode on me if I don't get the 4 things I needed fixed.  I was told that it was \\\"unsafe and possibly dangerous\\\" to drive my car.  Needless to say I didn't have $1400 on me, or even the \\\"minimum\\\" amount of what they were going to do which was $600.  I went home deflated :(\\n\\nThen my friend suggested Ted Wiens (who I will write another awesome yelp review about).....AND HOLY BANANAS WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  Ted Wiens had my car up on their lot in like 45 minutes and was looking at it.  They even brought me out there to show me what was wrong (bent tire rod).  He said it will be like 2 hours to fix and the grand total?  $285.  Yes.  For Everything.  When I asked the guy about all the crap Meineke said I needed he literally said this: \\\"What?  Are you kidding?  Those A**holes have no idea what they are doing.:\\\"  He then proceeded to show me EVERY part on my car that Meineke said was \\\"so totally badly and completely damaged and unsafe\\\" and they were all fine.  Normal wear and tear.  No need to replace.  \\n\\nI think I hugged him.\\n\\nAnyway I just want everyone to know to NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER in your life use this Meineke, they will try to get you to spend unnecessary money!\n",
      "832 In town for the weekend and this place seemed like it could have potential. The food is homemade and the workers are nice. I ordered three pupusas: Loroco con queso, black beans and cheese and one with chicharron. They were good, but the didn't have as much in the middle as I am used to. Overall it was good, but I have had many much better pupusas.\n",
      "834 This is a standard business hotel. It is a bit run down. The hotel is close to Carnegie Mellon University (~1 mile) and also close to University of Pittsburgh. They see a lot of service and it is a busy hotel. The rooms are quite large and the beds are comfortable and large. \\n\\nThe rooms have free internet and the speed is OK. The internet is wired in the rooms but wireless in the lobby. \\n\\nThey hotel does not really have to do much to attract given their location, which in some respects is reflected in their service. The service is not bad but generic business type service.\n",
      "843 I think it's the lack of breakfast places in Pittsburgh that makes Pamela's so popular. I couldn't find anything special here except the value. You really get a lot of food for you money, and it's pretty good food, but it's not spectacular. I'll go on a weekday, but the wait on weekends isn't worth it. I can just stay home and eat cereal, thank you.\n",

      "857 OH XS, why must you be so amazing!?\\n\\nRight off the bat, the vibe is upbeat and people are lookin' good! You walk through the doors, up the stairs, and as soon as you you turn that corner, BAM! A vision like no other! It's breath taking and when I show my friends this club for the first time, I love the look on their faces when they see this view! You can either go straight to the dance floor or go either right or left to outside or a bar..  \\n\\nPoles are scattered along the club for dancing and to top it off they have two platforms with poles. I am not going to say that I am in favor of those poles, but only in favor to see some females display the level of intoxication!! Hey, it's Vegas, what do you expect!?\\n\\nFeel like gambling!? Don't worry, XS has it covered! Walk along the patio seating and along the pool where you will find another bar and a \\\"Party Pit' if you will.... One craps table and a couple blackjack tables as well! Of course, while actively gaming, your drinks are on the house!!\\n\\nI celebrated my birthday here last year and got the best service! Huge table and they even brought me a birthday cake! What girl doesn't like firework-like candles on her birthday cake!? My girlfriends and I danced the night away and what was great was that there was security always watching us. In Vegas, there are always groups of girls that go to clubs and it was nice to have a big buff guy there to keep an eye out!\\n\\nMusic is loud and everywhere you look, people are having a great time! Staff is easy on the eyes and move as quickly as they can! The staff keeps this place clean as it is the most beautiful club in Vegas. I expect nothing less from a club located in a 5 star 5 diamond resort.\\n\\nDebating on going? Don't! You will have a blast! I believe the doors open at 10. If I were you, get on a guest list. The line gets pretty long!\n",

      "859 Value is the key word in this equation. If I spend 15 on a pizza, I want a decent pizza. This left the lady and I looking at each other wondering where the rest of it was.

      "863 I must update this review.. This place is on the way out.. It went from 5 stars to 2!!! The managers and the best bartender have bailed and their service has gone to *beep*.   I knew they were trying to change into more of a bar than a restaurant but come on guys.. I have ordered the lettuce wraps multiple times here and they have always been excellent.  They brought out medium size raggity old spinach leaves and lower quality cold beef.. Twice..  Ughhh.. Im so disappointed.  Especially because it is in such a good location. \\n\\nSorry guys. It actually pains me to write this.  I was waiting weeks to write this and gave it multiple second chances.. I even got ROTD for my 5 star review of this place.. Ugh!\\n\\n-Ian M.\n",
      "872 My husband and I love going to Hot Pot places and only get the opportunity when we are in a big city like Edinburgh or London. Xiang Bala had a decent selection for the all-you-can-eat menu and had a nice choice of broths, although we saw the special board after we ordered.  \\n\\nI give it 4 stars considering all restaurant experiences in Edinburgh, but only 3 stars as a Hot Pot venue.  I like the buffet of sauces, but I didn't like the inconsistency of portion size.  The first time we ordered 2 meats, they shared a plate, the next time we ordered 2 meats we received two full plates, twice as much!  I felt bad that we didn't eat it all and wasted food.  \\n\\nI'd definitely go again, but wouldn't be my main hot pot spot if I were in NYC Chinatown or even London.\n",
      "885 Bad environment, worse food. Geriatric smokers coughing everywhere! How does this place continue to operate in Scottsdale?  Simply awful. Canned, mushy vegetables. Not a fresh ingredient to be found anywhere. The even have signage touting themselves for their ice cream. Don't get too excited, it's just Dreyer's. Avoid Randy's at all costs, considering the other options nearby. Disgusting.\n",
      "886 I WILL NOT BE GOING BACK.  My insurance covers a standard exam, including dilation.  When I got there, the attendant gave me paperwork to sign which included an agreement to have an electronic scan instead of dilation for an extra $39.00.  Both her and the paperwork made it sound like it was basically mandatory.  I had to fill out a form declining it and tell two attendants that I did not want to pay extra.  When I went to the doctor, she told me my eyes were \\\"healthy\\\" and I didn't need that portion of the exam, even though I've had it every other time I've been to an optometrist.  \\n\\nFinally, they REFUSED to tell my inter-pupilary distance.  I asked the doctor and she said that the eyeware people would not let her tell me.  I asked the eyeware people and they said the doctor wouldn't let them tell me.  Finally, after making a few fake excuses, the doctor told me that they didn't want people to know because they didn't want them to be able to order online.\n",
      "887 The fruit and veg from here isn't always at its best and I did once buy a bag of plums from here on the cheap just to find they'd gone off, but it was on the cheap and luckily for this review I know to slow cook them and they turned out to be delicious.  This means there is a risk if you are buying the really cheap or out of season items, but other than that you should be okay.\\n\\nIn general I don't want to put you off because there are some nice items on offer here, but you do want to keep your eye out for something that's simply too far gone.\n",
      "899 Fun entrance and nice decor.  Took a client to lunch and it was almost impossible to hear her speak above the music.  Note to self:  Don't bring anyone you want to talk to. The server noticed that we couldn't hear each other and offered to turn the music down.  It's one thing to create an environment, but just loud music for lunch doesn't cut it.  Food was good, but  $12.00 tacos seems a bit pricey.  Needs help on making the food live up to the prices.\n",

      "911 A friend decided to have her birthday shindig here and I have to say it was a great choice.  We had a party of 20 something including kids, so the space alone was nice to have. Everyone stayed entertained whether it was sitting in the comfy chairs/couches chatting away or playing a little cornhole and ping pong. We were there at least 5 hrs and I wouldn't have minded staying longer if I had the time.  Our server Britney was amazing! She was on top of it the entire time and super friendly.  Our entire group kept saying how great the service was. Not just Britney, but everyone helping her deliver everything we ordered. Will  definitely be back and will recommend to everyone! Thank s for a great experience!!\n",

      "917 I moved here from San Francisco almost 2-years ago and was looking for a higher-end salon for both color and cut. I searched high and low on Yelp and Kelly Cardenas was the first and only salon that I go to in Las Vegas for my hair. I read great reviews about Sara and have stuck with her since. She has great energy, style, professionalism and knows the latest and greatest about hair. Sara is the reason I keep going back to Kelly Cardenas Salon. She takes great care of my hair, tries different colors and styles and I'm thrilled every time. They also have a sound-proof room that they wash your hair and give you a nice neck and head massage. I look forward to my visits!! Thanks Sara!\n",
      "921 Have been here the past two Friday's joining friends for happy hour. It's now \\\"The Hungry Monk\\\" but same ownership and, doesn't seem to have changed much as far as setup or menu (other than maybe less emphasis on wings?). But the service has definitely improved. And as I've previously noted, they have a great selection of beers, so upgrading them based on my last two visits. \\n\\nI did view the menu last time in but was pressed for time so only able to get some seasoned fries. Will have to try the food and update again afterward.\n",
      "926 Went here on a sat night around 9. Place was not crowded, cool vibe though, nice and dark with comfortable booths and a wall of plasma tv's. \\n\\nBeer list was pretty short and disappointing but ordered a Four Peaks Kilt lifter.  \\nBurger list was pretty interesting but I ended up ordering the peppercorn burger and my wife ordered the sweet and spicy burger and split an order of half and half fries. The burgers were massive but the peppercorn burger was pretty plain, nothing to write home about, and not that tasty considering the price ($10). My wife's burger was great and way better than my burger. It has some sort of tempura on the burger with loads of sweet chili and was delicious. I guess the extra $2 bucks I spent on this burger made all the difference.\\n\\nAll in all the place is great to chill out have a beer, watch some tv, and grab a decent burger. Place though was over priced. 2 burgers, 1 beer, and 1 order of fries will set you back 40 bucks with tip. For 40 bucks I would rather go grab a steak and a beer. Not sure how long this place will last at this price especially for burgers.\n",
      "932 Blueprint needs some work. The feel of the restaurant is all over the place. They need to get one theme and stick with it. The food is average at best as well. Today was the second time I have eaten at Bluprint. The brunch prices are way to expensive for the portion size and quality of the food. They don't use fresh ingredients and charge prices like they do. We ordered the breakfast burrito and the huevos rancheros and both were $15. The burrito was very small and had bad store bought sliced sausage and maybe 10 black beans. The shell was so big all you ate was that and nothing else. The hash browns were bad as well. They didn't have any flavor. The huevos were set in front of us and the first thing is saw were un cooked eggs. How the cook sent that out to a table I will never know. The white of the egg was still clear! We mentioned it to the manager and he said he would fix it. After talking about the price and the poor quality of the food we had already ate we decided to get up and leave. We paid for the burrito and left. That is the first time i have ever done that. If you are going to charge $15 for breakfast items they better be great with fresh ingredients or good and big portions. This place is neither. Bluprint won't be around if they don't change and do it quick.\n",

      "942 I'm starting to get the impression that you are not supposed to expect a good experience when working with a car dealership. Everyone I talk to is like \\\"Oh yeah, that's dealers for you.\\\" What?? I wish I had known this!! The story of my experience is long. That's mostly because I went in to this dealership in Aug., they didn't complete my financing until late Sept. and it's October and I still haven't received my license plates! I had to go to the MVD today, wait for an hour, pay the replacement fee to get my new plate, because I figured that was easier than dealing with this dealership anymore! There were one or two involved in my experience that were pleasant and seemed somewhat genuine. The rest, were shady at best. They would dodge my calls, tell me anything to get rid of me. They had my vehicle that I was trading in-PAID FOR and worth more than the car I was getting from them. Twice I had to threaten to come get my car from them if they could not close my deal or call me back with real honest answers about the loan they were trying to finance me for. Only then, did I get anyone to get back to me. They tried to get me financed through a bank that told me on the phone I didn't even qualify for the type of loan they were trying to get me! The whole process took almost 5 weeks, the whole time, yes I had their car, but they also had mine. And the money that I was supposed to be receiving back from the deal!! This whole experience was more of a nightmare than I ever could have imagined. It's unfortunate that one business and one group of sales/finance people can ruin your opinion of what should be an exciting thing! I had a Lexus before, went through the Lexus dealership 3 years ago and I had a great experience. Too bad Berge. You've lost a customer for life!\n",
      "943 NOT recommended. HIGHLY Overrated. My review may have been different if we had beef, however, BATALLI restaurant.. HELLO!!!. It started with my wife ordering a Spanish Coffee with a return, deer in the headlamps gaze, and I, a Chopin Vodka. she was brought a cup of coffee with the  booze in a glass and an apology, \\\" we don't have whipped cream\\\". I was simply told that we don't have Chopin...I simply asked for anything potato (not a snob, just like potato vodka). Another apology...we don't have potato vodka...ok, Stoli on the rocks.\\nOK, on to the food...we ordered Scallops that came to the table cold and undercooked, my wife ordered the Italian Sausage pasta (ORECCHIETTE) and I the Lobster pasta (ANOLINI) and a side of Broccoli. My wife's pasta was undercooked but otherwise had good flavor, the ANOLINI was just bland and the portion just to small as an entre, the Broccoli was over cooked to the point that you could not cut it with the knife provided, and was tasteless. YES, my expectations were high, anyone with a TV should have high expectations as well...So, sorry to say, the only memorable thing about this experience was not forgetting to write this review when we got home.\n",
      "950 ah Chino. I have been going here for years, well actually the other location, but same place. This location is really hard to find if you don't know where it is.... it seems like the location is not really great for their business... but I dunno. This place is good in that bad kind of way. The food is greasy, it comes out on paper plates or in tin take out dishes. It pretty much always makes me feel sick after eating there.... but I still eat there because it's just good sometimes. I always get an emerald chicken burrito and machaca quesadilla in a combo with the jerk fried rice. The emerald chicken is good.... all white meat and really oniony. It's one of the more asian-y dishes. The machaca is good too, just standard shredded beef with tomato, garlic, and onion.The BF gets bean and cheese burritos and seems to like them. I think the thing that always brings me back is the free snickerdoodles. They're sooo good....and also they are free which makes them even better. So against my better judgment, I will keep going to Chino Bandito.... \\n\\n\\nOh, and if you're drunk... this place gets at least one more star.\n",
      "951 This review is for just the restaurant,\\n\\nI would have given higher, but you could smell smoke from the bar area,\\n\\nThe food was pretty good.\\n\\nI had the sirloin , vegetables and baked potato. Everything tasted good. The service was also good.\n",
      "957 I've come to this Meineke a few times with good results. Recently I brought my car in to get an estimate on some inner tie rods and a lower control arm that needs to be replaced. I got a call from them an hour later asking me if I am going to be able to afford to get this repaired right now or not (seriously). I replied, \\\"that really depends on how much it's going to cost\\\". They said they would take a quick look at it and get me a quote. Hours later I went back in because I hadn't heard anything and it was almost closing time, walked in to a full crew sitting around in the office just hanging out and was told they were trying to research and that these parts are not easy to find. Really? On a 2005 Dodge? That was probably 10 days ago and they still haven't called me back. Every other shop I called was able to get me a quote within 30 minutes and didn't insult me by questioning my ability to pay. Regardless of what (or if) their quote comes back at I can tell you they have not earned my future business.\n",
      "960 I have been torn about trying Smashburger since some of the reviews for their locations have been less than smashing.  Last night, we decided to try something different and decided to try Smashburger.\\n\\nI looked at the online menu and then went to this location which is near where I live.  I got the avocado club hamburger for myself and the truffle mushroom burger for my wife.  After finding out what Smash fries were, I got an order for each of us.\\n\\nSarah was the woman running the register last night and she was good answering my questions.  I'm sure she could tell it was my first time there.  She told me to have a seat and she'd bring the to go order as soon as it was ready.  In about 5 minutes, the order was ready.  Since there was no one else in the restaurant, I knew it was mine.\\n\\nA short drive home and we were enjoying the hamburgers.  They were good for a change.  They are somewhere in the middle between normal fast food hamburger chains and the upscale hamburger shops which have sprung up around Las Vegas.  The fries were good.\\n\\nI'm not going to make Smashburger a regular on my rotation schedule, but it was good enough that I'll be back sometime.  I need to try the nutter butter shake.\n",
      "965 1-6-15 My first visit.   I had a doctor's appointment nearby so I dropped in about 4:30PM.    First impression from outside..uh... mediocre.  Looks like any ol' bar.\\nThe inside is entirely different.  It's just pretty.  Because of the time I went, it was nearly vacant so I headed to the bar to eat.\\n\\nI wasn't sure what I wanted but I received menu, water, utensils, napkins, etc quickly and plenty of time to examine the menu, wine selection, beer selection etc and ask questions.  The server/bartender seemed genuinely nice as did what seemed to be a \\\"regular\\\" on the opposite side of the bar so we had a pleasant conversation before and during my meal.\\n\\nI ordered the Lobster Bisque and Scallops with rice cakes.  The Lobster Bisque was good and as a friend told me, it was hot.  (We both have the pet peeve of \\\"warm\\\" food.)  It was moderately priced so I didn't expect or receive chunks of lobster but flavor was good... I would have loved just a drizzle of brandy on top... but not everyone likes it that way.\\n\\nI really enjoyed the scallops.  It took me a while and and an explanation to figure out the \\\"rice cakes\\\" part.  The long, narrow dish contained a perfectly cooked scallop, then a rice cake, then a scallop, etc.  The rice cakes were actually similar to risotto balls.  The change in textures and flavors was a surprise but I liked it.  Seriously though, I haven't had such a perfectly cooked scallop in forever.  Good sear on outside that gave it a slightly smoked flavor and just barely, barely done.  \\n\\nI agree with other reviewers that highest mark goes for ambiance.  Given it was nearly empty because of the hour and slow period after the holidays, I really want to check it out on a Friday or Saturday evening and see if they can keep up the friendly genuine service, quick service, and good food.\\n\\nThe menu was pretty big so I would expect some things to be not so good.  One patron recommended the fried gnocchi... but that seemed sacrilegious to me (and higher probability of being less than stellar)\\n\\nI'm going to take a WAG and say the reviews about not so great food have to do with the larger than average menu.  Yes, I watch way too many cooking channel shows!!\\n\\nNone the less, I'm going back.  It's a beautiful restaurant and there's plenty of potentially delightful things on the menu so if they can execute consistently, it could new fav for me.\n",
      "967 Well for gourmet burgers it was ok. The server Dominic was pretty awesome. The establishment is clean, friendly, and family oriented. I know this review is coming a few months late but I honestly have nothing memorable about the food except for the bottomless fries and I do remember the burger I ordered was a bit dry and thinking if I come back here I'm never ordering THAT again. Wish I could remember what it was called...That was a plus. I will come by again if I'm in the area...have to give the place a second try. :)\n",
      "971 In theory I love Rose & Crown: Good people, good beer, good location, etc. \\n\\nBut sometimes they fail the service test, albeit unintentionally, due to staff and space challenges.\\n\\nWhen it's not packed and I can enjoy steady service from the pool room or out on the porch, life is just about perfect. However, if I'm jammed inside with 100 other people vying for the same bartender's attention, I kinda want to take my ball and go home.\\n\\nSo when you go to Rose & Crown, which I enthusiastically suggest you do, temper your expectations based on how busy it is. \\n\\nAll that said the food is dependable, the beer selection is legit, and it's an ideal place to check out a weekend soccer match or even Sunday NFL football.\n",
      "975 For the money, best buffet that I've been to in Las Vegas. There are better buffets, but you'll pay a lot more. The food here was good, and the area was also clean. I'd recommend this place over the much pricier places.\n",
      "978 If you're looking for greasy Chinese delivery, look no further.  Two pad thais and two egg rolls came to less than $20.  The pad thais were huge and left more than enough for next-day lunch leftovers.  The egg rolls were pretty greasy but hit the spot.  Not the greatest food I've ever eaten, but sometimes a girl just needs some really greasy noodles.\\n\\nDelivery available through Meals Delivered. and Campus Food.  (Campus Food is cheaper.)\n",
      "987 Overall, I was pleasantly surprised.  I was expecting it to be campy, and it was, but there also was a good amount of production involved in the live music show.  \\n\\nThere were several other acts (hoop dancer, magic show, gun fight) going on through the evening that each performer venue directed the crowd to (and kept the night moving), but the real gem here is the main music show.  \\n\\nI'm amazed that this family is still doing their show, and it is incredible.  A musician myself, I'm usually leery of such acts, but their band had a magnetic energy (and playful onstage banter), Big Jim and Sweet Mary can still SANG and their fiddler rivals the speed of light!  Very tight harmonies, a medley of moving patriotic songs & spirituals, and a healthy amount of crowd interaction.  \\n\\nThe band serves you through the dinner line, engaging visitors when the line lulls.  It is a humbling realization when you see them up on stage after dinner doing their thing.  They ran out of chicken about 2/3 of the way through the line and gave out ice cream vouchers to those people.  However, even without the chicken, they fill your plate.  I did not leave hungry.  \\n\\nI bought 2 vouchers through BuyWithMe for \\\"2 VIP tickets for a barbecue buffet, ice cream, and high-energy stage show\\\" for $40 (so, $20/person).  According to their website that should include \\\"VIP Seating / Includes Chicken and Beef Combo Meal\\\" and costs $36 per person.  What actually happened: it was not a buffet, but cafeteria style - one run through, one serving of each.  We did not receive ice cream vouchers with our dinner tickets, and did not receive VIP seating, unless if everyone else used the same VIP seating vouchers, and we were just four rows back in the VIP seating (out of five rows total).  So, that was disappointing.  I don't think it's worth the full admission price.  I enjoyed it, yes, but, even for the novelty of the show, I'd cap the adult price at $20.\\n\\nOverall, though, it's a good place to bring the kids.  They successfully recreated a completely different era for children (and adults) to lose themselves in, and get some history at the same time.  There is a lot of standing for acts other than the dinner/stage show, so not the best option for older folks or those with back problems.  Also, you'll enjoy it more if you choose a cooler month - only the stage show/dinner is inside.\\n\\nMy final word?  It was worth the voucher price and was a nice alternative to the standard dinner and a movie.  If I go again and bring the kids, we'll pop in just for the dinner/show and leave afterwards.\n",
      "988 this place does not deserve any stars at all. My boyfriend and I were looking for a breakfast place and we ran into this one. We thought \\\"how can you really screw up breakfast?\\\" LAGO DID!!\\n\\nWe went for brunch, i think we JUST missed breakfast and I think it was 10am when we came. We paid about $26 per person and that was $26 down the drain for each of us.\\n\\nThe scrambled eggs looked so runny (egg beaters not even real eggs) and the hash browns tasted powdery...(it was probably instant). LIke everyone else says, there was not much to choose from. The beef i had was SO salty, at least it wasn't dry. The oatmeal was okay.  I had salad and I felt i could make a better salad at home. There wasn't many toppings or dressings to choose from. The best thing there was probably the fruit. Nothing really looked that appetizing so I didn't eat too much. \\n\\nWe were both really disappointed with this buffet, especially with it being in such a nice hotel, you'd think it would be better! It was so bad that i forgot I was even in a nice hotel, I thought i was in some dinky hotel.\\n\\nListen to me and everyone else, STAY AWAY from this buffet.\n",

Apologies, I was just daydreaming about the Green Burger.\\n\\nIf I could suggest to a meat-eater a place for them to experiment with eating like a veg, no doubt this would be the place.\\n\\nIf I could suggest to a veg a place to have a mouth-gasm, no doubt this would be the place.\\n\\nOk, now that we've gotten that out of the way, let's talk food.

I'm a fan of the huge, size-of-your-face pizza slice persuasion, so I've never gone that route at Green.\\n\\nRegardless, I would be willing to slap a $5 down on the table in front of someone at Green, and if they didn't like the food, they could take it and walk.\\n\\nTheir tofu/mock-chicken/mock-beef/mock-pork bowls are yum, yum, yum. I stick with the Singapore tofu, and it never fails to make my stomach smile.\\n\\nAnd their tsoynamis are oh-so good. No, that's not a mistake, people. It's a soy Dairy-Queen-blizzard style cup full of sunshine. EVERY one I've tried has blown me away. Some I like better, but I can't judge. It's sweet. It's soy. It's goooood.\\n\\nSometimes when it's lunch time, or a busy Friday or Saturday night, this place can get packed. It's usually full of the hipster and indie kinds of people, but, that shouldn't in any way make you not want to eat there, especially if you don't look this way.

I do understand why but it was just weird. I actually walked around with more expensive merchandise at other Best Buys with no problem. I prefer not to come to this location ever again lol.\n",
      "55 Our very first visit and I couldn't be more pleased! Excellent food, very friendly owner and staff. I can't believe I've lived in this area for three years and have only just now discovered it. If you like middle eastern food don't miss this little gem. You won't be disappointed!\n",
      "81 I love love love love this place! It's a few blocks from work & I go here daily. I usually get the breakfast wrap with the green goodness smoothie with no agave! I have a routine down, Presto for Breakfast & Greens & Proteins for Lunch! You should really check this place out, Reza & his cousin are great guys and are always so nice and polite. Friendly faces are good to see!\n",
      "133 I brought my 2004 For Ranger to this shop after reading some reviews on Yelp. The 5 star rating holds true. I took my truck in for an oil change and a tire rotation, which cost $27. They also looked at my spark plugs, which I didn't have the funds to replace. But they took pictures of the spark plugs (because I dropped the truck off) and showed me why they need replaced. \\n\\nThe shop is also family owned, with the mom running the front and the dad and son in back working on the vehicles.\\n\\nI will be going back.\n",
      "143 After living in Charlotte for about a year, and  trying 3 or 4 sushi restaurants, I've finally found one to that I'd return to. Having eaten here 4 or 5 times now, I've never been disappointed. I have only eaten sushi rolls at the bar and cannot speak to anything else offered on the menu. Everything I have tried has been wonderful. The fish and eel are all prepared perfectly and the sauces compliment the dishes well. Service has been friendly and attentive. One negative is the prices, which are a bit on the high side. This has not however kept me away and I'll be back.\n",
      "180 If you're looking for the only place to spend more than $300 for dinner, come here. I promise, you won't be disappointed! \\n\\nSW Steakhouse is a very classy and swanky restaurant. Here's the scoop on why I award them a 4.0 GPA:\\n\\n+ Seating was very quick, but I recommend making a reservation because this place is uber popular. \\n+ The servers were right on key with EVERYTHING. You definitely get what you pay for. The management here really keep the ambiance and experience top notch with every aspect of the meal. For example, my ice tea (not a big drinker obviously) was always filled. My colleague's 1/2 bottle of wine was poured perfectly\\n+ All the food came out in a timely manner! Very important especially when there's multiple guests in your party. \\n+ Our servers were very professional, but funny. Their humor felt real and I felt a good connection with them. \\n+ The food was absolutely excellent: veal (scrumptious and tender with the bone in...) Thanks to SW, I've found my favorite food of all time. crab soup was filling and was presented in a artful way, making it better tasting! \\n+ For me, it's all about the bathroom, but at SW, they gave us this dessert that lifted my spirits so high! Sounds corny, but damn, I was hella happy. I saw in the corner of my eye this dessert structure of mini funnel cakes on a mini tree lined with fat strawberries and 3 dipping sauces. I seriously hope I'm this happy when I get married. \\n\\nLastly, know that you're paying for excellence here so don't be surprised. If you have it in your budget to have dinner here, I highly recommend it. And don't forget to try that dessert. Maybe you'll be as happy as I was.\n",
      "181 Finally got a chance to check out Arrogant Butcher with a buddy of mine and I'm impressed. I definitely liked it better than I thought I would. We sat at the chef's table overlooking the hustling bustling kitchen, what a treat. The atmosphere in the restaurant was very nice, not too over the top and the service was great. It was a very laid back meal and experience.\\n\\nWe started out with the salumi and  a bleu cheese plate, both very good. The salumi was served with sweet mustard and crusty bread. The bleu cheese was served this jelly, It tasted kind of like raspberry. Both were verry good, and I think 5 or 6 bucks a piece. For my meal, I opted for two appetizers: Potato fritters with creme fraiche and truffles and the mussels with pork shoulder and pommes frites. Both dishes were awesome. Somehow, they managed to make the potato fritters super light and airy, out of this world. The mussel dish was great too, humongous portion of well cooked mussels in a killer broth. Add in a few Stella's and my total bill was around $50 with tax and tip. A little higher than I'd like for a quick stop in meal, but definitely well worth it. I'll for sure be back to try some of the other good looking items on the menu.\n",
      "206 As a fat guy, I've gotta love the name!\\n\\nStopped by at about 9:30 on a Sunday morning and there was a pretty good crowd.  Thanks to the other Yelp reviews, I kinda/sorta knew what I was doing.\\n\\nHad the adobado taco and a couple o' lengua tacos with everything.  Very good and reminded me of street tacos in Mexico that I consumed in a former life.\\n\\nSolid food, and a very friendly staff!  I'll make the trek down Charleston to Tacos El Gordo on my next visit.\n",
      "207 This place was great. I really haven't had a better pedicure. The massage was long, the hot stones (included!) were amazing, and the chairs were comfortable. The atmosphere was nice as well. Typical nail salon interior, but the employees were nice, not all on their phones (which happens a lot in other salons), and it was a relaxing place to be. I enjoyed it quite a bit. I will continue to come here for pedicures!\n",
      "217 One of my new favorite haunts. The good thing about living at Mill & Southern is a great bar selection within a block or so, OK so I'm into dive bars, it's almost heaven. The first time I went into the Timeout, it reminded me of a hundred bars back home in Pittsburgh. I didn't feel alot of personality the first couple times, not until I met and made some friends. It's a bar that plays pool, as you can see by all the trophy's and the bulletin board cluttered with league info. I'm a casual player so it's a little intimidating at first, but everyone there is great. That's the allure; the people. You can't look around and see it in the fixtures, it's the conversations, the eclectic hair, the young, the old, the ones with blue chalk wiped on their pants and spilling PBR as they giggle away. The bartenders are fun and easy on the eyes-Daddy Like!\\nAND, last but not least, I dig the jukebox and the tunes that get downloaded, alot of punk, new wave and other tunes that I grew up loving.\n",
      "218 Have had 3 bad experiences at this location. One was when they gave me the wrong food when I ordered online, then the next time they messed up half of my online order and then the 3rd time I went into dine they made my burrito so small it was not filling. They are extremely conservative with all of their burrito making. Would not recommend going to this location.\n",
      "240 super bomb!!\\nfeels like the one in cali!\\nreally love the shrimp + whole shebang flavor!!\n",
      "241 Is the best cigar shop I have found. Prices,Service and Selection were all great..\n",
      "269 Best grilled chicken in Charlotte! Pio Pio!\n",
      "273 Oh what a terrific restaurant this is!  On this second visit (for me) I was joined by Robyn N., & I ordered what I suggest YOU try for your first visit, a Carne Asada Torta Norte\\u00f1a with salad for the included side.  (Skip the chips & order a 99 cent side of their delicious ceviche if you want a little something more.)\\n\\nWhat you get here is stellar everything!  It's a clean, it's comfortable, the service is friendly & attentive, the food portions are generous, & the prices reasonable.  You will leave full, & having just eaten some of the best food you have ever tasted!  YUM!!     :-))\\n\\nCarne Asada Torta Norte\\u00f1a $7.49.\n",
      "365 I loved this place! My BFF4LIFE.. made a good choice! The room was beautiful... nice view, distance mountains. The location was a bit off the strip (which I didn't mind) but it was banging! The staff was lovely, the guest were friendly and the ALCOHOL WS... FREEEEEE! =)\n",
      "368 Ask for Trinity but you should probably call ahead and get and appt because she is often booked. That being said make sure you know who you spoke with because they will act like you never called. She does a great job. I have gone w/ someone else when she was not available and was disappointed. The shop over all is a 2/3 star but Trinity makes it 4\n",
      "405 NOT much of breakfast eater but my cousin from Sac in town and decided too meet up with my brother and my nieces at their favorite breakfast joint. I have been too few times just never got around too reviewing it. One thing really like about The Cracked Egg location so close too the house plus if this one busy then go five min down the road too there free standing restaurant. (I never been). It kind of small place so depending when you go there chance wait. We all meet up on weekend and good thing went early because by 10am the place was insane and line out the door. Go early or late breakfast/lunch crowds not your thing. \\n\\nThe Coffee Cake the bomb. I went with chili cheese omelette. It was really good! It had right portion of chili and cheese. The seasoned potatoes without doubt MY FAVORITE things on the menu. Sure you seasoned potatoes at any breakfast joint but the thing stands out for me is the seasoning mix they put on them. I have no idea it is. All I know is potatoes are addicting could eat plate of potatoes be in complete bliss. I put some ketchup on them but really tasty eat them by themselves. They nice HOT. Crispy on the outside. I also had the sandwiches on the menu are solid and makes for great breakfast/lunch. One thing after spoiling myself with Red Velvet Pancakes at BabyStack wish they had some too. It one type of pancakes they don;t have but have other yummy options comes too pancakes. Everything on the menu is solid had few things on the menu and loved it!\\n\\nThe service had always been great! Even when its super busy the service always been great, staff if very friendly, and great way too start the day with meal at The Cracked Egg. =))\n",
      "414 Just great to have a nice moment.\\n\\nBroad selection of wine. Ask for Alex's advice, he is surely one of the best sommelier you will ever meet.\\n\\nWe will go back, no doubt about it.\n",
      "437 This is my favorite bar in Las Vegas!! The drinks are so cheap and there is always a good atmosphere! I come here every time I'm in Vegas\n",
      "458 Loud Hip Hop, salty margaritas and a nice variety of tacos. Ma\\u00efs is definitely a unique experience.\\n\\nThere was a long wait for a table (they don`t take reservations) but the host gave us the option of passing on a cell phone number which he would call when a spot was free. This was great as it was very very cold outside and the place is tiny so waiting-in wasn't an option. We headed down the street for a drink and ended up missing the call - making our wait a bit longer when we called to check. The owner was GREAT about this - he brought us a round of tequila shots because we waited for a table for over an hour but honestly it was mostly our fault. \\n\\nMy margarita was awesome and authentic and had fresh coriander. Sorry what?! FRESH CORIANDER. So I was pretty happy about that. I had two.\\n\\nThe tacos were good. Nothing to write home about.....reasonably priced and unique flavors.\\nMy favorites were the carnitas and the squash, black bean and fresh cheese. The crunchiness of the pork rinds on the carnitas was a really nice touch, and who doesn't like fresh cheese?\\n\\nAll in all, I enjoyed the drinks and the vibe (young, loud, dark, intimate) of this place more-so than the food but I will definitely be returning to see what other taco flavor combinations they come up with\n",
      "559 I loved this theatre!!! its is nice and spacious. also very clean. its a bit old compared to other theatres in vegas, and the 3D sucks. so old school. the reason why I also love this theatre is they always do media screenings for movies, and I get to see them thru go fobo. that's the reason why I don't mind spending money on their expensive not so good popcorn and soda\n",
      "562 *ring ring*\\n\\nSports Authority...\\nHi do you have black and white referee shirts?\\nYeah, let me go check the sizes.\\nGreat.\\nWe have medium through extra large.\\nAwesome! And do those have a collar like a polo shirt? \\nYeah. \\nGreat, I'll be in today. \\n\\n*time passes*\\n\\nUhm, excuse me are these the only referee shirts you have?\\nYup.\\nOk because I was told you had one with a collar.\\nNo, just those.\\nWell I wish I knew before driving all the way over here.\\nYeah, sorry about that.\\n\\n(had to grab it anyway, with only a few hours before an event in Phoenix requiring me to be in some sort of football related garb, the collar less V NECK was the best I could do with limited time)\\n\\nGRRR\n",
      "567 Love this place! The staff is always friendly and they have great  beers on tap. Can't ask for much more! They serve cartel coffee and beer, btw! We had the bruschetta, but would loved to try more food, just had dinner afterwards planned. Definitely stop by this place!\n",
      "597 I bought a groupon for a facial from Massage Envy and for $40 I got the royal treatment for 1 hour.  This was the first facial I've had so I'm not exactly sure how it's supposed to work, but I thought they did an excellent job.  My expectations weren't very high when I walked into their little business located in a shopping strip in the Park Rd shopping area.  I was quite impressed with the way they maximize what little space they have.\\n\\nUpon entry I was led into a small relaxing room where I filled out my paper work.  Their forms asked specific questions about my skin and what kind of products I use.  They also asked what qualities I look for in an esthetician.  I really liked that they went over what I had written down, asked me about it and then tried to do what they could to provide the type of service I wanted.\\n\\nThe lady who performed my facial, Melissa, was great.  She was very knowledgeable and my session was relaxing and informative.  By far the best part of my hour session was the scalp massage!  I would almost pay full price just for that part alone!  Now if only I could train my husband to give a scalp massage like that...\\n\\nI had a great experience and if I find room in my budget I will definitely go back.\n",
      "617 I started to go to this place when they first opened! It WAS amazing for a few months. Seemed like they had the best teachers in the whole world there. TRX- unbelievable results in a couple of months, great Vinyasa, Bootcamp...so I bought a year membership there. Soon after the changes started to happen. They would take away classes on the schedule and make \\\"fusion\\\" classes instead. We asked management to put back those classes as they were the best and always full- The attitude of \\\"managers\\\" was like they were doing us a favor and we should not complain for the price we paid..etc...Disgusting!..few weeks have past and 2 of the best teachers were let go and than more followed...First, their classes were taken away, than they either left of was sent away. \\nThe place is going down so quickly,...EGO is the KING there. Teachers come and go, the place is dead. No qualified instructor for TRX, and they started kids aerobic. For Christ Sake!! What is going on??? This could have been the Best place in town. Shame on You management, you don't deserve to have any business here!!!\n",
      "618 In a word.Awesome! I was looking for a Chicago bar to watch my Blackhawks and yelp found Brando's and I found my new family! I've never felt so welcome before. From the time a walked thru the doors. From the Bartenders , especially Megan and my Waitress Heather and owners who are hands on. Make you feel like part of the family . And I can't forget about the food! Chicago style pizza to sliced beef, served wet or dry. You can't go wrong! Great prices and service bring me back every time. I found Chicago in Vegas!!!\n",
      "629 I'm like Penny Lane x; that I wouldn't have tried this place if it wasn't for YELP!!! - Now, I am a fan; only been there 1 time; but this place has delicious, Singapore Rice Noodles (a entree I seen to judge all dim sum places on) - the portion easier feeds 2-3 people and runs higher than normal dim sum prices (but, it well worth it)...All of the other dim sum items were great that I tried.  Go early, because we got there at 11AM and 15-30 minutes later there was almost no tables/booths left.\n",
      "694 This is a five star museum.   I seriously can NOT give this less than five stars.  It opened this year, 2012, in February, and you can tell that a lot of time and money was put in to the development of it.  It is still in pristine condition and let me say, it is fantastic.  \\n\\nI have to say that the beauty of this museum is that they made it interesting for everyone in the simple fact that no matter what YOUR way of learning is, there is something that will pique your interest.  You will discover the mafia connection in the United States from the early 1900s to the present, in print, in artifacts, in videos, and in sound.  It is three stories of amazing detail and experiences.  You'll hear from mafiosos and FBI agents.  You'll see movies and you'll hear real wiretaps.  You'll see the actual clothes worn in the golden age of Vegas Wiseguys and the actual barber chair that Albert Anastatsia was shot in.  The show in the ACTUAL courtroom where the Kefauver hearings took place was really wonderful.\\n\\nThere was only one thing that we saw that was a problem and that is they haven't finished adding all of the tags that tell you what things are.  For example, there is a graphic exhibit that discusses murders and the weapons used and the weapons are not labeled.  This is an area they are still completing.  It's still awesome to see, but I can't wait until they have that finished.\\n\\nWe visited this museum and paid our $18 a head to get in ($14 for seniors!).  We spent, approximately, 1 hour per floor on three floors that gave us the history of the mob from the top floor down to today.  It was one of the best museums I have visited and I highly recommend anyone visiting Vegas take some time to take a look at this.  I loved it and will probably visit again in the future.\\n\\nReally... do this  But, I don't recommend for children.  It's an adult experience.\n",
      "700 Ah golden dragon I heart you. My grandmother is the one who showed us this little gem-apparently its very popular with the sun city (65+) crowd, but who can blame them? They have a killer ayce dinner special for $11.50pp but surprise... It's NOT buffet style. You order off a full menu and everything is made fresh to order! Make sure if you are doing the ayce to let the server know before you start ordering. \\n\\nYou start off with the appetizers and soup. They have the standard selection of apps; egg rolls, potstickers, pork spare ribs, fried shrimp etc. etc. Tonight we got bbq pork, cream cheese wontons (10) and I got a cup of hot n sour soup. The apps came out fairly quickly and everything was hot and crispy. So much better then when it's buffet style sitting out under heat lamps and getting soggy! Then after apps you can order entrees and rice or noodles. They have a good selection of chicken, beef and seafood entrees as well as different fried rices, noodles and egg foo yung.\\n\\nWe ordered honey walnut shrimp, shrimp pad thai and mongolian beef to start. The walnut shrimp is my favorite it's so sweet and delicious. Not calorie friendly at all but that's what makes it so good. The mongolian beef was tasty but lacked spice. Actually now that I think of it all their \\\"spicy\\\" dishes are not spicy at all so I have to subtract 1 star! I like a little kick with my food especially when it is supposed to be spicy. Anyways we ordered another round of wontons and sweet n sour pork and I was so full after that my bf had to roll me out of there! \\n\\nA few things to note. If you order the ayce you MUST eat everything and they do frown upon leftover food. They have threatened to charge for any leftovers although it has yet to happen but just be aware. The portions are not huge but I do think they adjust the portion sized based on how many are in your party. I've gone with a party of 7 before and the entrees seemed to be bigger whereas they seemed to have less food when it was just me and the bf. And lastly they don't require reservations but they are recommended for large party. Also keep in mind this review is for the dinner special ONLY. You could of course order ala carte items and they also have take out but this is the best deal and we all know how much I love a good deal! my suggestion would be to go with a group so you can sample a little bit of everything. :)\n",
      "713 Great steak fajitas!!! I was super hungry after a night of cocktails & craps..I like the liveband and the decor, we'll def be back next time.\n",
      "743 So, after hearing about Delux from co-workers and Yelp, I had to try it.\\n\\nGetting there early helps, because the restaurant gets packed quickly. \\n\\nFirst off, the place is ultra chic. A large bar/table is in the center of the restaurant, highlighted with blue lights. This place oozes of sleek.\\n\\nBut enough about the lighting, onto the food!\\n\\nI got the Delux burger, which was incredible. Medium rare beef, served up on arugula with gruyere and a mixture of onions and bacon was incredible. The bun, a super soft baguette style was incredible as well. \\n\\nJuice dripped from this burger. Not grease, but juice.  Pure, delicious, incredible, beef juice. If I could bottle and sell it, I would.\\n\\nMy fiance had the turkey burger, which was excellently spiced, a tad dry, but the aioli helped cover that dryness.\\n\\nTheir fries were also tasty, I enjoyed the ketchup and aioli. However, I have had better sweet potato fries.\\n\\nTheir beer selection is awesome, including selections from 4 Peaks, I had an excellent Kolsch-style lager, that complemented my burger well.\\n\\nThe prices are a little high, but the burger does make it worth it, both size and quality\\n\\nOn a final note,I wouldn't recommend coming here at night, it seems like over priced drinks, loud music, and lots of stuck up people.\n",
      "755 We ended up here purely by accident and loved it! We were looking for a place to go dance and as we were walking by Caesar's a guy was outside handing out passes for no cover before midnight. We took the passes and headed into the Casino. Right in front of Pure was another guy handing out the same passes and he told us to get into the Guest List line which was shorter,even though we weren't on the guest list. We were inside the club within 5 minutes of entering the hotel. \\n\\nPure is pretty much a rooftop club overlooking the strip. I danced for hours just looking at the Eiffel Tower. Can't complain about that, now can you? The DJ was awesome and I wish I can remember his name because I loved pretty much everything he played. The drinks were pretty pricey but I guess you can expect that in Vegas. I'd definitely come back!\n",
      "757 Finally made my way over to four peaks, and left nice and tipsy, off all the different beers i had to try..so all in all i can say i left very happy :)\\n\\nService was great, and i love the inside of this place. \\n\\nI looked over the menu it is \\\"typical\\\" bar food in my opinion, HOWEVER not so typical was hummus so of course i had to try it, and it was flippin fantastic!!! ( yes im a hummus whore,  I have to try a new one every chance i get)\\n\\nGreat happy hour prices, i'll be back fa sho!\n",
      "776 Best burros, ever! Had the green chili burro, enchilada style with green sauce and the bean burro enchilada style with red sauce. AWESOME. The family vibe was even better! Marissa, is very welcoming and kind.! It will be my weekly stop! I'm serious! The Munoz family has proven how good they are by their success of Rito's in Central Phoenix. We are so lucky they have brought their good stuff to the west valley!\n",
      "795 I gotta give them 5 stars.  I love the old house ambiance and the friendly service.  My Italian pasty was excellent and enough for two meals.  They have a great beer selection.  Be sure to enjoy their patio when the weather is nice.\n",
      "804 Terrific food!  Great drinks.  Usually very busy but will worth the wait!  Nice place white table cloths even!\n",
      "805 The ramen and the fried rise are amazing the only bad thing is the service was rude\n",
      "820 This building is beautiful inside and out. I came here for Innovation Arizona Summit last week and it was my first time there. Well, inside. I've walked and ran by millions of times. But actually walking inside was a real treat. The summit was a very successful event and I enjoyed exploring the TCA for the first time. It's a very artsy and visually appealing place. I loved seeing the Pedestrian Bridge at sunset from inside. Very cool.\n",
      "831 Gotta Love Oliveos!!!\n",
      "874 Great place. Nice atmosphere. First time I went, very pleased!! Just went on Tues., came home that night gel nails already peeling!! I paid 70.00 for a gel pedicure. I was satisfied with that. (little pricey) As for my nails very disappointed.  Paid 40.00 so thick and tacky, I hope to go back and see what they do for me. Going on vacation in two days and wanted nice nails\n",
      "875 Today was my 6th class, chronic lower back pain is greatly reduced already. The first couple of classes I struggled just to stay in the room. Today I not only had no trouble completing the class but did not skip any sets or postures ( a huge accomplishment for me). The studio is clean and instructors are knowledgeable and chairing.  Looking forward to the benefits of consistently coming here.\n",
      "879 My printer won't connect to my laptop. It's really annoying. It means I can't print simple documents. What do I do when I need these simple documents? I was worried that requesting a printing job for 40 sheets in black and white would seem too small. Not for Pace Print. They happily printed off 20 sheets, one-sided, black and white and then another 20 sheets black-and-white double-sided, at the grand total of \\u00a36. Sure it's more expensive than if I had my printer up and running, but I was in a pickle and they happily did this for me.\\n\\nKudos to the staff member who served me. He was really friendly and helpful.\\n\\nI simply had to email them a PDF of my document and they emailed me once it was printed and ready to collect (in around half an hour). I really couldn't fault the service at all.\n",
      "898 Unlike the previous review, I've ate here. 4-5 times, and each time I've had EXCELLENT food and service. Never had anything bad, free kids meal on the weekends with a paid adult, and the owners are extremely nice. Can't say anything bad about this place! If you're looking for a good place to eat that won't break the bank, this is the go to place.\n",
      "916 Good recipes, nice atmosphere, and an interesting menu are frequently ruined by inattentiveness in the kitchen.  Meats are often dry, tough, and overcooked, though the vegetarian options are still delicious.  Ali Baba is a place with a lot of potential, but it needs more skilled professionals behind the curtain.\\n\\n(Also, the water glasses are unusually small, requiring many refills and usually causing periods without water during a meal--you can ask for a bigger one, though, something I didn't learn until my third visit.)\n",
      "929 Very good meal -- a la carte dinner. And service above and beyond. Must go back for the buffet.\n",
      "956 I am originally from NYC, where the Chinese food reigns supreme... and when I moved out here it was hard to find anything that was even remotely close to good.... While China Red is still not NYC amazing Chinese food, it definitely comes close. The portions are nice and big, the flavors are great, and the egg drop soup is fab! They offer lunch specials, which are hard to beat since the price is about $6 for 2 meals worth food :) PLUS, they deliver, which is hard to find out here in AZ!\n"

      "Very disappointing. \\n\\nCame early Saturday evening, around 5:30, and it was packed.  Wait for a table for 2 was 45 mins. You can't make reservations despite what their (infuriating and confusing) automated answering machine said.\\n\\nOk, no problem.  I'm willing to wait for good food and to try a new place.  Luckily, we snagged two seats at the bar within 10 mins.  It was all downhill from here...\\n\\nCocktails were awful.  They don't carry Tito's, so I went with a Stoli (up with a twist).  Not good.  The perfect vodka martini should be ice cold with shards of ice crystals and citrus oils.  Mine was cold-ish... and had a thick awkward corkscrew of rind balanced on the rim.  Whatever.  We moved on to the specialty \\\"cockytails.\\\"  DIABETES. seriously. we tried the blueberry skinny tea and cool as a cucumber and they both tasted like sugar water.  The one/only good thing was the jalapeno bacon moonshine.  We took shots of that and I would recommend.  Very jalapeno-y and bacon-y and... yah, first time I've had a savory shot and I liked it.\\n\\nFood was mediocre to awful.  We were about to order the fried okra when the people next to us said it was bad.  My friend tried some of the neighbor's  -- mushy and bland and gross.  Biscuit was undercooked and unimpressive. Appalachian egg rolls were dripping with oil, yet not crispy (I imagine the oil wasn't hot enough), and just meh.  Shrimp and grits were fine... but nothing special.  The fried egg and bacon sandwich with home fries were also fine... but it was no different from what I could have made in 5 mins. on any given weekend morning.\\n\\nService was obviously lacking because the place was slammed and we were at the bar.  Let's go with \\\"N/A\\\" here.\\n\\nWe opted to skip dessert.  I just don't get how there's so much hype surrounding this place.  \\n\\nTL;DR -- Wait for table is long; cocktails will give you diabetes; food is mediocre.\n",
